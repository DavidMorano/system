RMSHM

This command removes (unlinks) a POSIX shared-memory segment from the
system.  Any process that already has the shared-memory segment
attached continue unaffected.  But new attempts to attach this existing
segment will fail.  A new segment with the same name can be newly
created after the existing segment is removed.

Synopsis:

$ rmshm [<shmname(s)> ...] [-V]

where:

<shmnames(s)>	names of shared-memory segments to remove
-V		print the command version to standard-error and then exit
