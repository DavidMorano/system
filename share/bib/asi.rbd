%X On-chip balanced drivers can essentially eliminate
inductive noise, without any power dissipation penalty, and indendently of
the number of chip drivers switching simultaneously or the switching speed.
In addition, balanced interconnections on PWB's and MCM's substantially 
reduce crosstalk, increase noise
immunity, and eliminate ground noise.
