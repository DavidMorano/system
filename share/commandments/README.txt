# COMMANDMENTS
#
# This directory contains databases for the COMMANDMENT program
# and the COMMANDMENTS database-access object.
#
# The files in this directory serve as individual COMMANDMENTS databases.
# Each database file is wholly in text and should contain a list of
# commandments.  Each commandment consists of one or more lines of text
# started with a commandment-introducer number on a new line by itself.
# The commandment-instroducer number should be a positive decimal number
# at the beginning of a line of text and terminated by a period character.
# Commandments are terminated by the introduction of a new commandment
# or an empty line.  Comments in the file are introduced by the pound
# ('#') character starting a line (not necessarily in the first column
# but before any non-white-space characters).
# 
# An optional number-zero commandment is allowed but its use is
# unspecified.
