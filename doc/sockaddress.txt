SOCKADDRESS

This (object) is an attempt to make some sort of common interface
for setting, getting, or otherwise manipulating or using UIX socket

there is the issue of each address faimly hacing their own
socket-address objet.  But secondarily, and actually even more
painful, is that fact that individual socket address objects
(structures) are different acorss mutliple different operating
systems,
