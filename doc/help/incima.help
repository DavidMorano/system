INCIMA

This is a DWB filter program (like 'eqn' and 'tbl') but it recognizes
a request to include a picture of some sort.  It takes the picture and
translates it to EPS for inclusion into a DWD-like text document.

A directive to incllude an inmage should appear as follows in the input
text stream:

.\"_
.\"_ format file(page) h w pos off flags label
.BG pnt scrollhead.pnt 3.5i 5.0i c 0.0i
.\"_
