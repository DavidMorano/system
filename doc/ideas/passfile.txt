Transport Connections


Connections that are passed on the pass-pipe can be preceeded with some
data that provides additional information about the subsequently passed
connection.  This data is passed by passing the name of a file that
contains the additional information.

Additional information that may be in the passed file (specified by the
passed file name) includes :

item		description
-------------------------------------------------------

transport	incoming transport provider
username	username of passing user (UID is determined elsewhere)
hostname	host name of originating host
ident		identification of originating user (if known)


The UID owner of the file must match the subsequent UID of the passed
file descriptor in order for the association between the two to be
made.
