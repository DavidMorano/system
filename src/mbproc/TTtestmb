* TRIPS EDGE Architecture Tutorial (at ISCA'05) Call for Participation

  "Design and Implementation of the TRIPS EDGE Architecture"
             Saturday, June 3, 8:30 am - 5:00 pm
      http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/cart/trips_tutorial

The computer architecture community is currently in the midst of a
rare transition. The effort of moving to wider-issue RISC and CISC
processors has been all but abandoned due to power and complexity
limitations. Power limitations coupled with diminishing returns have
also greatly slowed improvements in clock rate, which will now come
solely from faster devices (15% per year) instead of faster devices
coupled with deeper pipelining (40% per year from 1990 to 2004). The
slowing performance gains from traditional processing cores has
produced an industrial shift of focus to chip multiprocessors. While
CMPs will doubtless improve the performance of many workloads, this
trend puts the burden of improved performance squarely on
programmers. Furthermore, applications that are too difficult to
parallelize will not benefit from the CMP trend.

An alternative is Explicit Data Graph Execution (EDGE) architectures,
which, unlike RISC and CISC instruction sets, explicitly encode
dependences into individual instructions. This encoding permits
dataflow-like execution without the hardware overheads of conventional
out-of-order processors, in which the hardware must reconstruct
dependences on the fly. While CMPs of EDGE processors are certainly
possible, they also provide the option of scaling to wider-issue
cores, improving single-thread performance further with no programmer
intervention needed.

The TRIPS architecture is an example of an EDGE architecture that
supports a static placement, dynamic issue (SPDI) execution
model. TRIPS programs are compiled into graphs of predicated
hyperblocks, each of which is represented internally as a dataflow
graph, with instructions communicating directly though
instruction-encoded dependences. Each hyperblock has a set of input
and output registers, which is how communication occurs between
them. The TRIPS architecture supports up to a maximum of 8
128-instruction hyperblocks to be executing on a processor core
simultaneously, thus enabling a 1,024 instruction window. We have
designed a full proof-of-concept implementation of the TRIPS
architecture, each chip of which contains 2 16-wide out-of-order issue
cores, and a 1 MB static NUCA cache.

This tutorial will cover the architecture and the microarchitecture of
the TRIPS prototype in detail. We will briefly show how EDGE
architectures have the capability of addressing power, wire delay, and
complexity issues. We will cover the salient features of the
instruction set in details, emphasizing the trade-offs that we found
during its definition. We will then explore the microarchitecture in
detail, focusing on the components that differ from conventional
architectures. The emphasis will be on both high-level issues and
implementation challenges. Finally, we will present the new compiler
algorithms and implementation neccessary to compile high-quality TRIPS
code, as well as the results of a prototype performance analysis.

Our goal for the tutorial participants is to provide a detailed
understanding of EDGE architectures, implementation challenges,
performance trade-offs, and unanswered research questions. We have
reserved time for informal discussions and questions.

For more information on the project, please visit the TRIPS project
website at http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/trips.

Intended audience:
Any industrial practitioners and academic or industrial researchers
interested in learning about EDGE ISAs and the TRIPS implementation in
depth, as well as how they provide potential power, scalability, and
performance advantages for future CMOS technologies. The presentations
will assume that participants have a solid understanding of
traditional architecture and microarchitecture techniques, such as
branch prediction and out-of-order execution, as well as datapath
design and pipelining

* Tutorial on Using the M5 Simulator at ISCA'05
  http://m5.eecs.umich.edu/isca_05.html

Introduction:
This half-day tutorial will introduce participants to the M5 simulator
system. M5 is a modular platform for computer system architecture
research, encompassing system-level architecture as well as processor
microarchitecture. Because the primary focus of the M5 development
team has been simulation of network-oriented server workloads, M5
incorporates several features not commonly found in other simulators
including:

    * Full-system simulation (using unmodified Linux 2.4/2.6, HP Tru64 5.1, or L4Ka::Pistachio)
    * Detailed timing of I/O device accesses and DMA operations
    * Accurate, deterministic simulation of multiple networked systems
    * Flexible, script-driven configuration to simplify specification of complex multi-system configurations
    * Included network workloads such as Apache, NAT, and NFS
    * Support for storing results from multiple simulations in a
    unified database (e.g. MySQL) for automated reporting and graph
    generation

M5 also integrates a number of other desirable features, including
pervasive object orientation, multiple interchangeable CPU models, an
event-driven memory system model, and multiprocessor
capability. Additionally, M5 is also capable of application-only
simulation using syscall emulation.

M5 is freely distributable under a BSD-style license, and does not
depend on any commercial or restricted-license software.

Intended Audience:
Researchers in academia or industry looking for a free, open-source,
full-system simulation environment for processor, system, or platform
architecture studies.

* Second Workshop on Temperature Aware Computer Systems (TACS) Call for Papers

Second Workshop on Temperature Aware Computer Systems (TACS)
June 5, 2005, Madison, WI
http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~skadron/tacs05

Held in conjunction with the 32nd International Symposium on Computer Architecture

Many analysts suggest that increasing power density and resulting difficulties in managing on-chip temperatures are some of the most urgent obstacles to continued scaling of VLSI systems within the next five to ten years. Just as has been done before for power-aware computing, "temperature-aware" computing must be approached not just from the packaging and circuit-design communities, but also from the processor- and systems- architecture communities. There is growing interest in cooling solutions from the processor- and systems-architecture domains, as evidenced by recent work on fetch throttling, dynamic voltage scaling, and process scheduling in response to thermal stress; and some progress has been made on modeling infrastructure for this kind of research. But research so far has only scratched the surface of what is possible. This topic area presents a wide-open field for new research, with lots of "low-hanging fruit", and interesting opportunities for wide-ranging inter!
 -disciplinary work.

This workshop will serve as a forum to explore a broad spectrum of topics pertaining to temperature-aware computer systems, for researchers from multiple fields to exchange ideas and initiate collaborations, and to continue establishing temperature-aware computing as an important research topic in its own right. Conributions from all aspects of temperature-aware design are encouraged, related topics like reliability, leakage, thermal sensors, etc.

We especially encourage submissions involving collaboration between architects and thermal engineers! In fact, the goal of this workshop is to stimulate the widest possible collaboration among architects and other engineers on topics related to temperature-aware design.

This is the second year of the TACS workshop. Last year's TACS, held in conjunction with ISCA-31, was extremely successful, with good attendance, four strong papers covering diverse topics, an exciting keynote speech by Luiz Barroso of Google, and a vigorous panel discussion.

                                  June 4-5, 2005

Overview:
=========
With few exceptions, simulation is the quantitative foundation for
virtually all computer architecture research and design projects -- from
microarchitectural exploration to hardware and software trade-offs to
processor and system design.  However, its continued efficacy is limited
by problems such as increasing complexity, additional critical constraints
(e.g. power consumption, reliability, etc.), an ever expanding design
space, benchmark suite quality and coverage, and radical changes in
processor architectures to compensate for technological changes (i.e.
reduced transistor widths, etc.).

The primary goals of this workshop are to accelerate the development of
simulation technologies that are necessary to support the research of
future generation architectures and to encourage the advancement of
under-researched. areas related to computer architecture measurement, such
as modeling, benchmark implementation and benchmark suite construction,
and formal methods of design space exploration and performance analysis.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* New or efficient techniques to model performance, power, reliability,
  etc.
* Accurate but efficient alternatives to cycle-accurate, execution-driven
  simulation
* Simulator verification, flexibility and reusability
* Reduced simulation time techniques
* Efficient design space exploration
* Development of parameterizable, flexible benchmarks
* Formal methods for benchmark suite construction or benchmark suite
  sub-setting
* Techniques to measure the characteristics (weak spots, coverage, etc.)
  of a benchmark suite
* Analytical and statistical processor modeling
* Choosing processor and memory simulation parameters

Submission Guidelines:
======================
The authors should submit a 200 word or less abstract by 9 PM (CST) March
7, 2005 to the workshop website.  The full paper should be 5000 words or

    Workshop on Duplicating, Deconstructing, and Debunking
                 http://www.ece.wisc.edu/~wddd

               Held in conjunction with ISCA-32
                       Madison, Wisconsin USA
                        June 4, 2005

-------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT DATES
---------------

  Abstracts due:   April 15, 2005
  Submissions due: April 22, 2005
  Acceptance:      May 2, 2005
  Final version:   May 23, 2005

WORKSHOP OVERVIEW
-----------------

WDDD provides the computer systems research community a forum
for work that validates or duplicates earlier results; deconstructs
prior findings by providing greater, in-depth insight into causal
relationships or correlations; or debunks earlier findings by
describing precisely how and why proposed techniques fail where earlier
successes were claimed, or succeed where failure was reported.

Traditionally, computer systems conferences and workshops focus
almost exclusively on novelty and performance, neglecting an abundance
of interesting work that lacks one or both of these attributes.  A
significant part of research--in fact, the backbone of the scientific
method--involves independent validation of existing work and the
exploration of strange ideas that never pan out.  This workshop
provides a venue for disseminating such work in our community.
Published validation experiments strengthen existing work, while
thorough comparisons provide new dimensions and perspectives.
Studies that refute or correct existing work also strengthen the
research community, by ensuring that published material is technically
correct and has sound assumptions.  Publishing negative or strange or
unexpected results will allow future researchers to learn the
hard lessons of others, without repeating their effort.

This workshop will set a high scientific standard for such
experiments, and will require insightful analysis to justify
all conclusions.  The workshop will favor submissions that
provide meaningful insights and point to underlying root causes
for the failure or success of the technique under investigation.
Acceptable work must thoroughly investigate and clearly communicate
why the proposed technique performs as the results indicate.
Rebuttals may be invited for debunking submissions.

SUBMISSION TOPICS
-----------------

  * Independent validation of earlier results with meaningful analysis
  * In-depth analysis and sensitivity studies that provide further
    insight into earlier findings, or identify key parameters or
    assumptions that affect the results
  * Studies that refute earlier findings, with clear justification
    and explanation
  * Negative results for ideas that intuitively make sense and
    should work, along with explanations for why they do not

  * EXPANDED SCOPE: In addition to the topics of computer architecture
    and microarchitecture that have previously been the focus of WDDD,
    this year's workshop is being expanded to include papers in the
    related areas of code generation and optimization, including efficient
    profiling mechanisms, static and dynamic optimization, feedback
    driven and adaptive optimization, and modulo/trace scheduling.


SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
---------------------

  * Submit a 200-word abstract plus title and list of authors in
    plain text email by April 15 to tcain@us.ibm.com.
  * Submit a 5000-word or less (brief and to-the-point submissions
    are strongly encouraged) double-spaced manuscript by April 22
    as a PS or PDF file on the workshop website www.ece.wisc.edu/~wddd

Inappropriate submissions, as described in the submitted abstract,
will be rejected outright.  Similarly, inflammatory, abusive, or
overtly combative and negative submissions will not be considered.
Accepted papers will be published in the ISCA-32 workshop proceedings.

Y. Sazeides, R. Kumar, D. M. Tullsen, T. Constantinou. "The Danger of
  Interval-Based Power Efficiency Metrics: When Worst Is Best." Volume
  4, Jan. 2005.

Abstract:
This paper shows that if the execution of a program is divided into
distinct intervals, it is possible for one processor or configuration
to provide the best power efficiency over every interval, and yet have
worse overall power efficiency over the entire execution than other
configurations.  This unintuitive behavior is a result of a seemingly
intuitive use of power efficiency metrics, and can result in
suboptimal design and execution decisions. This behavior may occur
when using the  energy-delay product and energy-delay^2
product metrics but not with the energy metric.


O. Mutlu, H. Kim, J. Stark, and Y. N. Patt.  "On Reusing the Results
  of Pre-Executed Instructions in a Runahead Execution Processor."
  Volume 4, Jan. 2005.

Abstract:
Previous research on runahead execution took it for granted as a
prefetch-only technique. Even though the results of instructions
independent of an L2 miss are correctly computed during runahead mode,
previous approaches discarded those results instead of trying to
utilize them in normal mode execution. This paper evaluates the effect
of reusing the results of pre-executed instructions on performance. We
find that, even with an ideal scheme, it is not worthwhile to reuse
the results of pre-executed instructions. Our analysis provides
insights into why result reuse does not provide significant
performance improvement in runahead processors and concludes that
runahead execution should be employed as a prefetching mechanism
rather than a full-blown prefetching/result-reuse mechanism.

* DaMoN 2005 (First International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware) Call for Papers

First International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware (DaMoN
2005)
(http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~damon2005)

Baltimore, Maryland, June 12, 2005
(Sponsored by and colocated with ACM SIGMOD/PODS 2005)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------
Objective
------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------
The aim of this one-day workshop is to bring together researchers who
are interested in optimizing database performance on modern computing
infrastructure by designing new data management techniques and tools.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------
Motivation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------
The continued evolution of computing hardware and infrastructure imposes
new challenges and bottlenecks to program performance. As a result,
traditional database architectures that focus solely on I/O optimization
increasingly fail to utilize hardware resources efficiently. CPUs with
superscalar out-of-order execution, simultaneous multi-threading,
multi-level memory hierarchies, and future storage hardware (such as
MEMS) impose a great challenge to optimizing database performance.
Consequently, exploiting the characteristics of modern hardware has
become an important topic of database systems research.

The goal is to make database systems adapt automatically to the
sophisticated hardware characteristics, thus maximizing performance
transparently to applications. To achieve this goal, the data management
community needs interdisciplinary collaboration with computer
architecture, compiler and operating systems researchers.
This involves rethinking traditional data structures, query processing
algorithms, and database software architectures to adapt to the advances
in the underlying hardware infrastructure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------
Topics of Interest
------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------
We seek submissions bridging the area of database systems to computer
architecture, compilers, and operating systems. In particular,
submissions covering topics from the following non-exhaustive list are
encouraged:

 - database algorithms and data structures on modern hardware
 - cost models and query optimization for novel hierarchical memory
systems
 - hardware systems for query processing
 - data management using co-processors
 - query processing using computing power in storage systems
 - database architectures for low-power computing and embedded devices
 - database architectures on multi-threaded and chip multiprocessors
 - performance analysis of database workloads on modern hardware
 - compiler and operating systems advances to improve database
performance
 - new benchmarks for microarchitectural evaluation of database
workloads

******************************************************************

                   Held in conjunction with the
   32nd Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture

                       Madison, Wisconsin
                         June 4-5, 2005

Overview:
=========
With few exceptions, simulation is the quantitative foundation for
virtually all computer architecture research and design projects -- from
microarchitectural exploration to hardware and software trade-offs to
processor and system design.  However, its continued efficacy is limited
by problems such as increasing complexity, additional critical constraints
(e.g. power consumption, reliability, etc.), an ever expanding design
space, benchmark suite quality and coverage, and radical changes in
processor architectures to compensate for technological changes (i.e.
reduced transistor widths, etc.).

The primary goals of this workshop are to accelerate the development of
simulation technologies that are necessary to support the research of
future generation architectures and to encourage the advancement of
under-researched. areas related to computer architecture measurement, such
as modeling, benchmark implementation and benchmark suite construction,
and formal methods of design space exploration and performance analysis.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* New or efficient techniques to model performance, power, reliability,
  etc.
* Accurate but efficient alternatives to cycle-accurate, execution-driven
  simulation
* Simulator verification, flexibility and reusability
* Reduced simulation time techniques
* Efficient design space exploration
* Development of parameterizable, flexible benchmarks
* Formal methods for benchmark suite construction or benchmark suite
  sub-setting
* Techniques to measure the characteristics (weak spots, coverage, etc.)
  of a benchmark suite
* Analytical and statistical processor modeling
* Choosing processor and memory simulation parameters

Submission Guidelines:
======================
The authors should submit a 200 word or less abstract by 9 PM (CST) March
7, 2005 to the workshop website.  The full paper should be 5000 words or
less and should be submitted in pdf format by 9 PM (CST) March 14, 2005.
Papers that are excessively long may be rejected without review.

* QEST 2005 (Quantitative Evaluation of Systems) Call for Papers

QEST'05 - www.qest.org
2nd International Conference on Quantitative Evaluation of SysTems
Torino, Italy, September 19-22, 2005

OVERVIEW
The International Conference on Quantitative Evaluation of SysTems is
a major forum for contributions on evaluation and verification of
computer and communication systems, through measurements and
stochastic models, possibly incorporating non-deterministic behaviour.
It combines three events: the International Conference on Modeling
Techniques and Tools for Computer Performance Evaluation (TOOLS), the
International Workshop on Petri Nets and Performance Models (PNPM),
and the Joint International Workshop on Process Algebras and
Performance Modeling and Probabilistic Methods In Verification
(PAPM-ProbMIV), that have discovered an increasing convergence in
their interests and in their communities of researchers. The 1st QEST
conference was held at the University of Twente in 2004. The 2nd QEST
conference will be held in Torino, the city that hosted the first
PNPM workshop twenty years ago. Torino has also hosted TOOLS in 1991
and PAPM in 1996.

SCOPE & TOPICS
Quantitative properties of interest include, but are not limited to,
performance, dependability (e.g., reliability, availability), safety,
security, survivability, correctness, timeliness, and efficiency.
Topics of interest cover the areas of modelling formalisms and
methodologies, measurements, analytical and numerical evaluation,
simulation and verification, and theory of probabilistic systems, as
well as case studies showing the role of quantitative evaluation in
the design of systems and applications including computer
architecture, distributed and fault tolerant systems, communication
systems, embedded systems, web-based systems, and safety-critical
systems. Moreover tools for supporting the practical application of
research results in all the above areas are of special interest for
QEST and therefore tool papers are sought. Example topics of interest
include:
stochastic and timed Petri nets;
stochastic and timed process algebras;
stochastic and timed automata;
queueing networks;
Markov chains;
non-Markovian models and algorithms;
numerical and analytical solution techniques;
efficient simulation techniques;
formal specification techniques;
quantitative extensions of UML;
measurements and benchmarking;
schedulability analysis;
verification of stochastic and probabilistic systems;
concurrency theory for probabilistic systems;
analysis of randomized algorithms;
model-checking algorithms;
optimization techniques;
probabilistic decision-making and planning;
hybrid and hierarchical modelling and evaluation techniques;

SUBMISSIONS
We invite authors to submit papers with original material related to
the topics of the conference, written in English, and formatted in the
IEEE double column format. The length of the paper should not exceed
10 pages. Additional material for the aid of the reviewers
(e.g. proofs, definitions) can be presented in a clearly marked
appendix. Instructions for electronic submission will be given on the
conference home-page. Papers must be unpublished and must not be
submitted for publication elsewhere. Accepted papers must be presented
at the conference by one of the authors. The proceedings will be
published by IEEE. All papers will be thoroughly reviewed by at least
3 referees on the basis of their originality and their scientific and
practical contribution to the state of the art. An award for best
paper will be presented at the conference.

TOOLS SESSION
A special session will be arranged to present and demonstrate tools
relevant to any topic covered by the conference. Accepted tool
descriptions will appear in the conference proceedings (2 pages,
IEEE format).

WORK-IN-PROGRESS SESSION
A special session will be arranged to present preliminary work.

The 3rd ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems (SenSys) is a highly selective single-track forum for the presentation of research results on systems issues in the emerging area of embedded, networked sensors. These distributed systems of smart sensors and actuators connecting computational capabilities to the physical world have the potential to revolutionize the way in which the real world is instrumented, monitored, and controlled. Such systems present a wide range of challenges because of resource constraints, uncertainty, irregularity, and scale.

SenSys provides a cross-disciplinary venue for researchers addressing the rich space of networked sensor system design issues to interact, present and exchange research results, and demonstrate their work in a hands-on research exhibition. We seek technical papers describing original, previously unpublished research results.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, novel results in the following areas of research in sensor  Sensor network architectures and  Distributed coordination algorithms (e.g., for localization, time synchronization, clustering, topology control,  Failure resilience and fault  Energy  Operating  Data, information, and signal  Data  Distributed actuation and  Programming  Security and  Network planning, provisioning, and  Operational experience and  Experimental methodology (e.g., repeatable experimentation, measurement infrastructure, simulation, emulation,  Analysis of real-world systems and fundamental   Integration with other systems (e.g., Web-based information systems, process control, enterprise software, etc.)

The conference time-line is as follows. All deadlines are firm; please do not ask for extensions. To submit papers, go to http://sensys.csail.mit.edu.
