PCSINFO

One component of traditional PCS name handling is that users on the
system are handled both as being indexed by usernames as well as their
real names.  Indexing by username is easy and goes directly to the
system username-lookup subroutine interface.  However handling system
users by their real names requires a reverse index is order to get back
to a username.

The database looks like:

david.a.morano|morano
john.d.morano|john

or

david|a|morano|morano
john|d|morano|john


A query like:

d.mor

would result in two lookups.  The first is to the last-name index with
the key 'mor'.  Since there are only indexes by 2 characters and 4
characters, we need to do a 2-character lookup on the last-name index.
We also do a 1-character lookup on the first-name index.  We then take
the intersection of those two lookup results (database join) and then
do full comparisons on the remaining hits.
