TEXTSET

This is the famous (infamous) TEXTSET program. This program typesets basic raw
input ASCII text files to the output (using TROFF source language). The
difference between this program and a miriad of other programs which perform
similar functions is that this program is device independent (unlike 'postprint'
and its variants) and can render varying fonts and fonts sizes as well as
vertical line spacing.

This program can also put out custom page headers, unlike if you use PR!
