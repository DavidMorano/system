SKYPEALERT

This little program is a server for incomming skype-alert indications. It is
called with an argument specifying a possible username that is supposedly the
recipient of the alert. The server checks if the user exists and if so creates
and sends both interactive alerts and an alert mail message.

Synopsis:
$ skypealert <username>

Arguments:
<username>	specifies the recipient of the alert
