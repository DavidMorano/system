MKKEY (issues)

Q. Should we add an option to "include" the delimiter line(s) in the entry
range like to use in the quote source input, or for some other purpose?

A. I don't think so -- at least not at this time.  Although this stuff
all seems simple enough, it is more complicated to implement than to
think about.
