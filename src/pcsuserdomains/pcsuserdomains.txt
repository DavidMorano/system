PCSUSERDOMAINS (obsoleted by Solaris 'user_attr' database)

The function performed by this program (building or rebuilding the the PCS
user-domain database) may be obsoleted by the use of the Solaris 'user_attr"
database.  That database can be augmented with a database item key 'id' to
specify a domain for a user.
