TEXTCLEAN

This program cleans up text from the damaging effects of contamination
with WinTel platform exposure.


= version 0a

This is the first verson of this program.  This whole program should be
rewritten in LEX or YACC!  It is a mess as it is.

= version 0b

Finally fixed, implemented correctly, the "strip leading white space" feature.
Also, I fixed what appeared to be a bad logical error in that control-Z
characters were not being removed from the ends of the stupid DOS files!
