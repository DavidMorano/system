* Overview    Switch2OL v4.9

The Switch2OL script will convert the registration or complete distribution of
either RHEL or CentOS to Oracle Linux such that it can be registered with
either ULN or Spacewalk for Oracle Linux.

The script has flexibility to be run multiple times allowing a registration
conversion, (just the subscription management RPMs), a distribution conversion
or both at once.
There are several functions added to allow pre- interim- and post- processing.
These functions can be used to perform specific tasks as required by the user 
running the script. The actual intent is to allow Professional Services to make 
adjustments or accommodations for client situations.

Background:
The genesis of this script was as a DEMO tool for Sales Consultants. The
intent was to show the ease of altering a registration or complete distribution
to Oracle Linux and Oracle Linux Support.
To accomplish this, an Oracle Linux free repository, public-yum, was used to
pull packages to perform the specific task of registration. Later, conversion
was added.
If used solely for altering the subscription management, the goal
was to do as little harm to the system  and alter as few RPMs as possible.
However, the use cases of this script grew beyond this initial design.
Soon, it was found a conversion was desirable but not all packages were
altered, specifically, the kernel. This lead to among other things, a means
to replace the running kernel to ensure a complete conversion of packages.
Still a complete conversion eluded success. Hence, to accomplish a complete
conversion (especially where a distribution had included updates from a newer
revision), the task fell to this script to be flexible to which channel or
channels it would draw packages. In addition, for a complete conversion to
emulate an Oracle Linux installation, the UEK was pulled in.
It was not long before a request was made to allow this scrip to pull from
a local yum server, and then, not soon after, a spacewalk server.
Today, this script is capable of doing all the above with a good degree of
flexibility. For instance, either a public yum, or a local yum server can be
used for the initial package pull for subscription management and/or
complete conversion along with culminating in a registration to either ULN
or Spacewalk for Oracle Linux. Multiple flags, or arguments, were added to
the script to control the method and manner of these functions; including
altering the revision level during operation, using a proxy or independently
including or disallowing the UEK.
AS an interesting artifact of this script's evolution, when using the
public yum, altering the distributions minor revision level ensured that
the script could accommodate updates performed on the system prior to a
conversion. To achieve this, the system is first subscribed to the current
major.minor release where, the current kernel is pulled in to facilitate
the changing of the kernel signature to that of Oracle. Once the kernel has
been altered, then the minor revision is elevated either by the use of a
revision flag or a flag subscribed to the "latest" channel. An interesting
side bar, is, if a local yum is used, this action is not permitted, but,
if the local yum repository file where to duplicate the public-yum-ol?.repo
file, this script 'could' permit the use of these flags.


Operation of the script:
The script must be run as UID 0. There are a number of flags to control the
logic flow. Those flags are listed below. The default behavior (no flags) is to
simply alter the subscription management of the current distribution. This sets
up the system to allow for connection to either ULN or Spacewalk for Oracle
Linux.
Altering the subscription management, by design, affects the least number of
packages. However, should the -l or -r flags be used (allowed with the
either Yum as the repository engine) the script will consume more RPMs due to
dependency rules. The -l flag will cause the script to alter the current
distribution by using the LATEST subscription management RPMs.
The -r flag, which takes an integer value, will alter the current distribution
from a lower minor revision to a greater minor revision up to and including the
latest minor revision. Once that is done, it will again include the
subscription management RPMS at the -r # revision value.

At any time, the user can select to include the UEK by using the -k flag.
The -p (Proxy) flag can always be used.

Multiple execution instances:
The script may be run multiple times. The first invocation will alter the
subscription management. Once the subscription management has been altered any
subsequent run attempting to alter the subscription management will result in
no action taken. Hence, for example if the user first invoked the script with
no arguments, then decided to run it again with the -l or -r flags, there will
be no effective change to the system. However, if the -k flag is included in
the execution cycle, it will still include the UEK. All subsequent executions
of the script will accept any of the -o, -u, -y or -s flags. The flags -v or
-V can always be used.

A brief warning on the use of the “-V” flag. This causes enormous amounts
of information to be generated. Use with caution so as not to fill up your disk
if logging to a file.

Using a Local Yum Server:
This script by default will use Public Yum. It can be made to use an alternate
Yum repository. To do this the -y flag is used. The -y flag sets the script up
to look for a local Yum server and therefore takes two required parameters,
URIrepo and URIgpg. URIrepo and URIgpg point to the repository URI file
(http:://someplace/some.repo) and the URI location to the GPG Key
(http:://someplace.com/OracleGPG-Key) respectfully. It takes one optional
parameter YumLabel. YumLabel is a colon separated list of channel labels. These labels provide equivlant behavior to the -l or -r flags used with the public
yum or to permit the addition of channels to enable for processing.
In order to make the execution using a local yum equivalent with using the
public-yum, the script will attempt to download a repository file and place it 
in /etc/yum.repos.d. It will also attempt to consume an Oracle RPM-GPG-KEY and 
place it in /etc/pki/rpm-gpg and /usr/share/rhn. Both these parameters specify 
a URI, meaning a path to, and the name of the file. No error checking is done 
on the URIrepo file. This means whatever channel(s) is enabled, will be used. 
The -l and the -r flags will not be disabled but the YumLabel parameter is
available to provide equivalent behavior. Again, the -k flag can be used, but 
if no channel for UEK is available, it may cause a failure.  Lastly, 
the URIgpg must be present because regardless of whether the script uses 
public-yum or a local yum server, gpg checking is enabled to ensure only signed 
packages are installed.
When using the -y flag, it is the responsibility of the user to ensure the 
proper repository is being used. There may be a high likelihood of RPM "crumbs" 
being left behind during a complete conversion. Hence, the user must be 
prepared to deal with such events, in particular, the kernel RPM.



Converting the entire distribution to Oracle Linux:
Converting the entire distribution is accomplished using the -o flag.
Along with the -o flag any of the -l, -r and -k flags can be used.
(It is important to note when converting the distribution to Oracle Linux the 
-k flag is no longer implied. Meaning the UEK will not be pulled in 
automatically and must be specifically requested). The -o flag will cause the 
script to first ensure the system is ready for conversion. This is accomplished 
by first altering the subscription management RPMs. It does this because 
usually using the -o is a set-up to register with either the ULN or Spacewalk 
for Oracle Linux.
The -o will interrogate the RPMs on the machine and install the Oracle 
equivalent RPMs into the exiting RPM Database. Using the -o also alters the 
signature authenticity of any kernels found, including the effective kernel 
(running kernel). In this way, an interrogation of the system following the 
execution of the script will find no previous distribution packages remain. 
However, should some predecessor RPMs exist, they will be itemized at the 
conclusion of the run. 


Connecting to ULN:
The script allows for the registration of the distribution to ULN using
the -u flag. It will require a single-sign-on and CSI number to succeed.
Be prepared to enter this information at the prompt. No "batch" mode is 
provided should this operation be selected. Registering to ULN requires the 
use of the ULN interface which is interactive.

Connecting to Spacewalk for Oracle Linux
The script allows for connecting to Spacewalk, using the -s flag, to complete 
system registration.  However, this operation is mutually exclusive to, and, 
takes precedents over connecting to ULN. This flag takes up to eight additional 
pieces of information. To properly allow for connecting to Spacewalk the 
serverUrl, activationkey, sslCACert and optionally spacewalk clientURI must be 
provided. Whereas the first three parameters are required, the clientURI is not.
Should the clientURI not be present, the Oracle Public Yum repository spacewalk 
client will be used, UNLESS the -y flag is present. If the -y flag is present, 
the local repository must contain the necessary spacewalk client RPMS in a 
spacewalk repo separate from the URIrepo file.  Whereas registering with ULN is 
interactive, registering with Spacewalk for Oracle Linux can batched.

Registration is the last action performed by the script. Any time the script 
exits successfully a list of files not converted, and any rpmnew or rpmsave 
files will be identified. Additionally, the repository file will be disabled.


NOTE:
It is not necessary to convert the distribution to Oracle Linux in order to 
register to ULN or Spacewalk. Hence, a -u or -s flag can be given with the 
first invocation of the script. That said, once the box is registered, no 
further action will be taken by the scrip; not even accepting the -k flag at 
that point. 

     
This script disables automatic updates during the conversion process. It will 
restore the state of the packagekit once the script completes.

The following flags are available upon executing the Switch2OL script.
Usage:Switch2OL [-h] [-v] [-V] [-k] [-l] [-r MinorRevision] [-o] [-u]
                   [-y URIrepo=<URI of Repo File> URIgpg=<URI of GPG KEY>]
                   [-p Proxy]
                   [-s serverUrl=<URI of Spacewalk server XMLRPC> \
                       activationkey=<channel activation key>\
                       sslCACert <URI to RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-CERT>\
                       [[clientURI <URI to client Spacewalk Repo>]]
                   ]  
-h      Display this help and exit
-v      Verbose
-V      Greater Verbosity
-k      Install the UEK kernel
-l      Upgrade to the latest minor revision (default is to leave the
        system at its current revision). This option is only available
        if the Oracle Public Yum is used.
        NOTE: If NOT converting the distribution to Oracle Linux, meaning
        only altering the subscription management more than the minimal
        set of packages may be consumed during a subscription management
        migration.
-r <number>  Set Distribution Minor revision to a MinorRevision.
             This option is only available if the Oracle Public Yum repository
	     file is used. NOTE: If this flag is used without the -o
	     flag, it could cause more than the minimal set of RPMs to
             be consumed during the subscription management migration.
             The Revision flag takes one value (integer)
        Examples: with and without spaces,   -r 5 or -r11
-o      Remove all previous packages and replace the authenticity with
	  Oracle Linux Distribution equivalent RPMs.
-u      Register with ULN (default is to register to yum.oracle.com)
-y      Specify and pull the Oracle packages from a private or local
        YUM repository. The local repo file must have the same labels
        as that of the public-yum repo file except replacing the "public"
        with "local". Additionally, the user must ensure the channels
        needed for both the registration switch (at the same level) or
        a higher level is present and pointing to a valid repository.
        If the -l or -r flags are set, those repositories must also
        be present and available for use. This falg also takes an
        optional value pair, YumLabel. YumLabel is a colon separated
        list of channel labels to be turned on along with the already
        enabled channels in the local yum repository file.
        The user must ensure the proper repository is used for
        the conversion. The syntax for this flag takes TWO required KEYWORD
        value pair parameters. All parameters have a value association.
        The parameters can be a comma separated list, equivalence pairing ('=')
        or any combination. The keyword parameters must appear as shown in any
        order.
          URIrepo - The value associated with this parameter provides
                    the path to, and the name of, the repository
                    file to use.
          URIgpg - The value associated with this parameter provides a path
                   to, and the name of, the RPM-GPG-KEY to import.
        keyword syntax Examples:
            URIrepo <repository file>,URIgpg <gpgkey file>
            URIrepo=<repository file> URIgpg <gpgkey file>
            URIgpg=<gpgkey file> URIrepo <repository file>
            URIrepo=http://someplace.com/file.repo \
             URIgpg=http://someplce.com/GPG-KEY \
             [ YumLabel=my_channel1:gold_channel:uek_channel]
-p      A Proxy to be used. You only need specify the <Server:port>
-s      Specify, associate and register to a Spacewalk Server
        This flag is mutually exclusive with -u. The -l and -r flags
        may be used but all updating or conversion will be done prior
        to regisering with the Spacewalk server.
        SpaceWalk is handled the same way as registering with ULN.
        It is the last operation performed because there is
        pre-processing that is required before altering the
        Subscription Manager. Hence for initial package conversion
        the -y flag or the default Oracle Public Yum may be used.
        There is no repository checking done when this flag is
        set.
        The user must ensure the proper repository is used for
        the conversion. The syntax for this flag takes FOUR KEYWORD
        value pair parameters; with clientURI being an option keyword value
        pair. All parameters must have a value association.
        The parameters can be a comma separated list, equivalence
        pairing ('=') or any combination. The keyword parameters must appear
        as shown in any order.
          serverUrl - The value associated with this parameter provides
                      the path for setting up the remote procedure
                      calls for the Spacewalk server.
          activationkey - The value associated with this parameter provides
                          activation key used to associate the client
                          to a particular channel or channels.
          sslCACert - This value pair specifies the path to and the
                      file consisting of the RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT
          [clientURI] - This value pair identifies the spacewalk client
                        repository URI. NOTE: This is an OPTIONAL pair
                        and only needed if specific client packages for
                        initial setup of the spacewalk client is needed.
                        It can only contain the spacewalk client repo
                        information.
        Keyword syntax Examples:
            serverUrl <server XMLRPC>,activationkey <Key> sslCACert\
		  <cert> clientURI=<URI repo>
            clientURI <spacewalk repo> serverUrl=<server XMLRPC> \
               sslCACert=<cert>, activationkey <Key>
            serverUrl=<spacewalk server>,activation=<Key>,sslCACert <cert>


* Examples
Run verbose. The -v and -V switch can be used individually or combined for
desired verbosity. The -V switch however generates a great deal of output.:
Switch2OL -v

Convert to Oracle Linux Distribution using the latest revision and register
to ULN:
Switch2OL -olu

Use a Local YUM server instead of the Public Yum
Switch2OL -y URIrepo=http://example.com:/path/to/file/repofile.repo \
             URIgpg=http://example.com:/path/to/GPGKey/RPM-GPG-KEY-oracle

Register the system with ULN:
Switch2OL -u
- Note: the system will receive a minimal set of packages identifying it
        to register properly with ULN.

Convert the distribution to Oracle Linux using ULN and set a specific minor
revision. (The switches are not positional, but the value for 'r' must follow
immediately.):
Switch2OL -ou -r 7

Alter the updates to Public Yum and include the UEK in the distribution:
Switch2OL -k
