LOGDIR

This is the famous 'logdir' ('logname') program. It is usually supplied with
System V UNIXes but not always supplied with BSD types of UNIXes, hence we
create it! This program can double as LOGNAME.

This version of LOGDIR is an enhanced version of the standard System V version
in that it returns the correct information for the correct user logged in rather
the just the information for the UID of the logged in user.

Synopsis:
$ logdir <name>
