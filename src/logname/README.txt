LOGDIR

This is the famous |logname(1)| program.  It is usually supplied
with System V UNIX©es but not always supplied with BSD types of
UNIXes, hence we create it!  This version of LOGNAME is an enhanced
version of the standard System V version in that it returns the
correct information for the correct user logged in rather the just
the information for the UID of the logged in user.

Synopsis:
$ logname [<username>]
