# This file should contain lines that have two fields.  The first
# field is the date of the count (of events) given in the second field.
# The fields should be separated by white-space.  The date should be given
# in the form of CCYYMMDD.  The count of events should be given
# in decimal.  The counts should be cummulative.  That is, each count
# contains the sum of the total number of events since the beginning.
# Although entries do not have to be ordered (in ascending order of dates)
# having them so avoids processing time sorting them.
#
# Empty lines and lines beginning with the pound ('#') character are
# ignored.
# 
# Example entry:
# 20080122	50000000

19730122	0
20080122	50000000
