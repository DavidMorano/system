RSHE

It is a simple but effective remote execution program. it gets the environment
over to another machine in addition to the normal remote execution function
(like with RSH). This is built on RSH but tries to offer some of the features
with the old AT&T REXEC package (the grand-daddy of all remote execution
packages -- which none has yet to ever live up to!).

This is a bad hack! It was quick and dirty and messy but amazingly (somehow) it
actually creates a fairly good illussion that something sort-of like REXEC is
being used! However, it is crap underneath and will fail on a poor excuse for
an RSH connection, which is not uncommon!

Your milleage may vary.
