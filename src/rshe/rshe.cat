          The rrrrsssshhhheeee program connects to the specified _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e and exe-
          cutes the specified _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.  This program is very similar
          to the rrrrsssshhhh program and is inspired by it and the RRRRXXXX program
          which is part of the RRRREEEEXXXXEEEECCCC remote execution package (not
          related to the common Berkley RRRREEEEXXXXEEEECCCC daemon) developed at
          AT&T Bell Laboratories.  The rrrrsssshhhheeee program uses the same dae-
          mon program on the remote machine as the RRRRSSSSHHHH program does.
          This is both a blessing and a curse.  It is a curse since
          the program's behavior is restricted somewhat by the fact
          that the same daemon is used as RRRRSSSSHHHH uses.  It is a blessing
          because many remote machines now-a-days will not be running
          any other remote execution daemons and we still want to get
          the best out of an already bad machine execution environ-
          ment.  Normally, the entire local environment is sent over
          to the remote machine (because this is what is usually
          desired in a tighly coupled local machine group) but this
          behavior is changed if the ----xxxx option is used.

          The rrrrsssshhhheeee program copies its standard input to the remote
          command, the standard output of the remote command to its
          standard output, and the standard error of the remote com-
          mand to its standard error.  Interrupt, quit and terminate
          signals are propagated to the remote command; rrrrsssshhhheeee normally
          terminates when the remote command does.

          If you omit _c_o_m_m_a_n_d, the rrrrsssshhhheeee program will try to execute
          whatever your SHELL environment variable is set to.  If
          there is not SHELL environment variable, it will try to exe-
          cute '/bin/sh' on the remote machine.  Shell metacharacters
          which are not quoted are interpreted on the local machine,
          while quoted metacharacters are interpreted on the remote
          machine. See EXAMPLES.

          Hostnames are given in the _h_o_s_t_s database, which may be con-
          tained in the ////eeeettttcccc////hhhhoooossssttttssss file, the Internet domain name
          database, or both.  Each host has one official name (the
          first name in the database entry) and optionally one or more
          nicknames.  Official hostnames or nicknames may be given as

          Each remote machine may have a file named ////eeeettttcccc////hhhhoooossssttttssss....eeeeqqqquuuuiiiivvvv
          containing a list of trusted hostnames with which it shares
          usernames.  Users with the same username on both the local
          and remote machine may rrrrsssshhhheeee from the machines listed in the
          remote machine's ////eeeettttcccc////hhhhoooossssttttssss file.  Individual users may set
          up a similar private equivalence list with the file ....rrrrhhhhoooossssttttssss
          in their home directories.  Each line in this file contains
          two names: a _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e and a _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e separated by a space.
          The entry permits the user named _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e who is logged into
          _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e to use rrrrsssshhhheeee to access the remote machine as the
          remote user.  If the name of the local host is not found in
          the ////eeeettttcccc////hhhhoooossssttttssss....eeeeqqqquuuuiiiivvvv file on the remote machine, and the
          local username and hostname are not found in the remote
          user's ....rrrrhhhhoooossssttttssss file, then the access is denied.  The host-
          names listed in the ////eeeettttcccc////hhhhoooossssttttssss....eeeeqqqquuuuiiiivvvv and ....rrrrhhhhoooossssttttssss files must
          be the official hostnames listed in the hhhhoooossssttttssss database;
          nicknames may not be used in either of these files.

          rrrrsssshhhheeee will not prompt for a password if access is denied on
          the remote machine.

          Options can appear anywhere on the command line, either
          before or after the specification of the remote host, but
          must appear before the specification of the remote command.
          Option key letters can also be freely concatenated together.
          If a concatenated option key requires an associated value
          string, it is picked up as the next tokenized string on the
          command line.

          ----llll _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e    Use _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e as the remote username instead
                         of your local username.  In the absence of
                         this option, the remote username is the same
                         as your local username.

          ----nnnn             Redirect the input of rrrrsssshhhheeee to ////ddddeeeevvvv////nnnnuuuullllllll.  You
                         sometimes need this option to avoid unfor-
                         tunate interactions between rrrrsssshhhheeee and the
                         shell which invokes it. For example, if you
                         are running rrrrsssshhhheeee and invoke a rrrrsssshhhheeee in the
                         background without redirecting its input away
                         from the terminal, it will block even if no
                         reads are posted by the remote command. The
                         ----nnnn option will prevent this.

                         The ----xxxx option is used to send some local

                         tem instead of all of the local environment
                         variables.  This is useful where local

                         ing on the remote system.  If the ----xxxx option
                         appears alone, the local environment variable
                         RRRRXXXXPPPPOOOORRRRTTTT (another inspiration of the AT&T RRRREEEEXXXXEEEECCCC
                         package) is consulted for a list of local
                         environment variables to send over to the
                         remote machine.  If the ----xxxx option has just
                         the equals sign after it (no spaces between
                         the xxxx and the ==== sign), then no additional
                         environment variables are sent over.  If
                         there is a comma separated list (no interven-
                         ing white space between list names) then only
                         those variables are sent over.  In all cases,
                         environment variables are only sent over to
                         the remote machine if they exist and are
                         exported on the local machine.

                         The ----eeee option is used to have an environment
                         file executed on the remote machine before
                         the user specified command is executed.  For
                         heterogeneous machine environments, ideally,
                         each different machine could have a file in
                         the user's home directory that could be exe-
                         cuted to provide the proper environment for
                         the user requested command.  Normally, a
                         user's ....pppprrrrooooffffiiiilllleeee type file serves this func-
                         tion but is not always the best choice when
                         executing many remote commands.  Usually, a
                         file is created with a list of environment
                         variables which are the essential set needed
                         for proper remote execution of commands.
                         This file should be able to be executed by
                         ////bbbbiiiinnnn////sssshhhh and should export any environment
                         variables that are desired to be in the
                         environment of the user requested command to
                         be executed.  This file can be the user's
                         ....pppprrrrooooffffiiiilllleeee type file but that may have
                         undesireable side effects.  The specified
                         file (what ever it may be) is executed with
                         its standard input, output and error
                         redirected to the ////ddddeeeevvvv////nnnnuuuullllllll file.  The speci-
                         fied environment file specified will not have
                         a controlling terminal either.  If this
                         option is used, the specified file is exe-
                         cuted before any further environment is sent
                         over either by default (the entire existing
                         local environment) or those local environment
                         variables specified with the ----xxxx option.

                         current working directory on the local
                         machine.  If the remote machine cannot find
                         or change to this directory, it exits with an
                         error return code.  The default directory
                         where the user's specified command is exe-
                         cuted is the user's home directory on the

          ----????             This option will cause a brief help message

          MacOS ?  we will see in time.

          Stop signals stop the local rrrrsssshhhheeee process only; this is argu-
          ably wrong, but currently hard to fix for reasons too com-
          plicated to explain here.

          Sometimes the ----nnnn option is needed for reasons that are less
          than obvious.  For example, the command:

               eeeexxxxaaaammmmpppplllleeee%%%% rrrrsssshhhheeee ssssoooommmmeeeehhhhoooosssstttt dddddddd iiiiffff====////ddddeeeevvvv////nnnnrrrrmmmmtttt0000 bbbbssss====22220000bbbb |||| ttttaaaarrrr
               xxxxvvvvppppBBBBffff ----

          will put your shell into a strange state.  Evidently, what
          happens is that the ttttaaaarrrr terminates before the rrrrsssshhhheeee.  The
          rrrrsssshhhheeee then tries to write into the ``broken pipe'' and,
          instead of terminating neatly, proceeds to compete with your
          shell for its standard input.  Invoking rrrrsssshhhheeee with the ----nnnn
          option avoids such incidents.  This bug occurs only when
          rrrrsssshhhheeee is at the beginning of a pipeline and is not reading
          standard input.  Do not use the ----nnnn if rrrrsssshhhheeee actually needs to
          read standard input.  For example,

               eeeexxxxaaaammmmpppplllleeee%%%% ttttaaaarrrr ccccffff ---- .... |||| rrrrsssshhhheeee ssssuuuunnnnddddiiiiaaaallll dddddddd ooooffff====////ddddeeeevvvv////rrrrmmmmtttt0000

          does not produce the bug.  If you were to use the ----nnnn in a
          case like this, rrrrsssshhhheeee would incorrectly read from ////ddddeeeevvvv////nnnnuuuullllllll
          instead of from the pipe.

          A significant difference from this program and the more
          popular RRRRSSSSHHHH program is that this program will not execute
          multiple commands enclosed in quotes like the RRRRSSSSHHHH program
          will.  This program will only execute a single supplied pro-
          gram along with its arguments (no funny business).

          The ----nnnn option should not have to exist.  It does exist
          because of some fundamental flaws in the way in which I/O is
          handled in both old (non-STREAMS) and new (STREAMS) versions
          of UNIX.  These I/O limitations do not exist in operating
          systems such as DEC's RSM-11M or DEC's VMS but, of course,
          these operating systems suffer from other problems (possibly
          quite numerous) also.  The ----nnnn option simple directs the rrrrsssshhhheeee
          program to not read its standard input and to instead return
          an end-of-file indication to the remote command's standard
          input.  Normally, the rrrrsssshhhheeee program continuously, and
          naively, reads its standard input becuase it is too stupid
          to know when the remote command issues a read to its stan-
          dard input.  This behavior can be ultimately traced to a
          fundamental flaw in the I/O subsystem of the UNIX operating
          system.  The UNIX operating system's I/O STREAM head
          (STREAMS is assumed for this discussion) does not provide

          any indication of how much data is requested by the program
          above the STREAM head.  For this reason, any and all STREAMS
          modules and ultimately programs residing on the client side
          of a network connection have to assume that the server side
          program continuouly wants input data.  This could have been
          long ago fixed in UNIX (circa 1982 at least) but no...ooo !
          The powers that were thought that they knew how to make
          operating systems and did not understand the need for a for-
          malized "read attention" type indication from programs issu-
          ing reads on the other end of a communications pipe (network
          or otherwise).
