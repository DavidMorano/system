FINGERGET

This is a tiny little program that opens a UNIX stream socket and reads any data
from that socket to standard output.

This program was a hack (and maybe a bad one also!). It was used in some sort of
weirdo way to pipe FINGER data around a networked system of some sort. I don't
remember how this all was plugged together at the time of conception!
