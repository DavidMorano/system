ULOG

This program is used to log a user in or out of the system without
actually logging in or logging out the corresponding session.  This
can be partially used to hide the current session from messages
that may come to a logged in session. Blocking of messages is
generally less extremely accomplished using the MESG program (for
general messages) or the BIFF program (for incoming mail indications).
