ULOG

This program is used to log a user in or out of the system without actually
logging in or logging out the corresponding session.

This can be partially used to hide the current session from messages that may
come to a logged in session. Blocking of messages is generally less extremely
accomplished using MESG (for general messages) or BIFF (for incoming mail
indications).
