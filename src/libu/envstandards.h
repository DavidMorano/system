	I had to experiment with the preprocessor define named 
	'_XOPEN_SOURCE' in order to get a reasonably working 
	system.  See below.

/****
On (messed-up) Darwin OS, one must define the preprocessor symbol
'_ANSI_SOURCE' in order to get the declaration for the kernel
subroutine |waitid(2)|.  But if we do so (on messed-up Darwin)
we get all hell breaking loose with many other declarions being
missing (for whatever messed-up reason). So we instead are
careful top NOT define that preprocessior sysmbol. 
Long live the messed-up Darwin OS!
Oh, and thanks so much for making me take hours to figure out
how this messed-up envronment works on Darwin.

On (the messed-up) Darwin OS, if we define the preprocessor symbol

careful to NOT define with any sort of value.
