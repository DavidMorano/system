/*******************************************************************************

        Contrary to a good bit of confusion (at least at the present time) this
        subroutine is indeed a system call. Why it was advertized as a STDIO
        call at one point was pure craziness. Maybe it is still advertised as a
        STDIO call with your implementation but it should not be. Check its
        object file for any crazy STDIO functions of variables.

        The confusion over this subroutine is just part of some of the wacked
        out craziness from the earlier UNIX® days. Yes, UNIX® went on to become
        big (I watched it myself through the decades from nothing to
        take-over-the-world status) but the guys up in the old Computer-Science
        Area-11 research division could have taken some time to have cleaned
        some things up before they got too entrenched (like the confusion over
        this subroutine call).
