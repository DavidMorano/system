USYS

This directory tries to provde a couple of ways to emulate missing
interfaces in different UNIX-like operating system implementations.
Smoothing over the various (much more than anyone might otherwise
guess) missing interfaces from the various UNIX-like implemenations
is not always easy.  Some operating systems (which will remain
nameless here but have the initials "Apple-Darwin") have more missing
components than others.  The vast majority of hacks located in this
directory are to supplement the Apple-Darwin operating sytem.
