SENDMAIL

Some of the more useful options to the SENDMAIL daemon program are:

option		description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-o i		ignore "dots" on the input message data!
-o IgnoreDots
-oi

-o 8		declare 8-bit data on input (this is like '8BITMIME'
		not 'BINARY') ; there is NO way to input binary data
		to SENDMAIL yet! (one would think this would have
		beed "fixed" years ago)

-o EightBitMode=<x>

		s	reject any undeclared 8-bit data on input
		m	convert any 8-bit data on input to '8BITMIME'
		p	pass any undeclared 8-bit data (just send 8)

-G		declare that we are doing a gateway transfer rather
		than an initial user injection

-o DeliveryMode=<x>
		i	deliver interactively (synchronously)
		b	deliver in background (asynchronously)
		q	just queue it up (default?)
		d	defer delivery and map lookups (queue it up)
