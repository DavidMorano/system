PRT

This is the PRT look-alike program to the AT&T UNIXSON version PRT. This program
is far simpler and does not do nearly the things that the UNISON version does.
But, we have the source code to this program and can change it to behave to
different environments.

Synopsis:
$ prt [-d <printer>] [-K "<key> <value>"] [-K <key>=<value>]
