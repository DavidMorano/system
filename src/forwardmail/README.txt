FORWARDMAIL.CRON

This is a 'cron' job that runs on remote machines to get and forward the email
to where ever, usually here, whatever. It is a hack! Hey, face it. Almost
everything in software is a total hack now-a-days! As usual, it you want it
better, hey all you need is a keyboard and some typing skills to write your own
program! :-) Ha, ha, ha !
