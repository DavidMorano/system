PCSUUCPD

You can run this program either in stand-alone mode or through the use of the
INETD server (or equivalent), if you have something like that. To start it as a
stand-alone server, run it as:

$ pcsuucp -d

or non-stand-alone with an entry in 'inetd.conf' such as:

uucp stream	tcp	nowait	nuucp /etc/bin/pcsuucpd pcsuucpd
