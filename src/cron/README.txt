CRON

This is the CRON facility that was shipped with Solaris-10.  It is very
specific to that (Solaris-10) environment.  It is not very suitable for
any OS other than Solaris-10 or later.  Also, (although not confirmed)
it probably still has a number of bugs (which is what we were trying to
avoid in the first place)!
