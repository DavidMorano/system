PRTDB

Printer configuration files are searched for both in the home directory
(generally under 'etc') and the program root of this program (generally under
'etc' of the program root).

Printer configuration files have the form:

	<utility>.<suf>

where these are usually:

utility		"prt"
suf		"pdb"

So an actuatal configuration file might look like this one:

	${LOCAL}/etc/prt.pdb

Enjoy!
