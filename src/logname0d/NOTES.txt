LOGDIR/LOGNAME

**NOTE** -> This program is completely obsoleted.  See 'userinfo'.

This is the famous 'logdir' ('logname') program.  It is usually
supplied with System V UNIXes but not always supplied with BSD types of
UNIXes, hence we create it !

This version of LOGDIR is an enhanced version of the standard System V
version in that it returns the correct information for the correct user
logged in rather the just the information for the UID of the logged in
user.


= version 0b

Both the 'logdir' and the 'logname' programs were merged into
one with this release.


= version 0c

This release allows for additional user information to be returned from
the 'passwd' database as well ther user's group name from the 'group'
database.

The following items are now available:

	logname         username        uid             gid             
	groupname       gecos           gecosname       mailname        
	homedir         shell           name            fullname        
	organization    nodename        hostname        domainname      
	nisdomain       password        passwd          euid            
	egid            realname        account         bin             
	office          wphone          hphone          printer         
	lstchg          lastlog
