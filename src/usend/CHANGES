USEND


Man is this a hack job !  It is amazing what will be hacked together to
get something transfered from one place to another !  Why is
networking, in general, so limited ?  The answer is probably because of
security but that is a debate for some stiff necked security types !

I removed all of the hack stuff that tried to find intermediate
machines to serve as gateways.  Life is too short for this kind
of hassle.  What should have been done long, long ago is to make
the whole UUCP system not dependent on source routing !

I also cleaned up a manual page that I found lying around some place.
No it is not Sun's or AT&T's.  Their versions of the USEND program
died a long time ago !  Sun had that weirdo 'uusend' program for
a while after (why, who knows) but I could not find anything on that
either.  Although the current manual page dates from '94, I think the
program goes back to the late 80s when we used STARLAN to transfer
files around !  I think that early versions of this hack would
use STARLAN for the last leg of the connectivity to the PCs from
the mainframes.

Later we used UUCP from the PCs to gateway UNIX boxes, and then UUCP
from those gateway boxes to the rest of the world.  It is this latter
hack stuff, gatewaying that used intermediate UUCP nodes, that I
stripped out.
