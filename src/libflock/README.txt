LIBFLOCK

This is a hack-library that contains the old UCB 'flock(3)' subroutine.
No one should use this except to satisfy old garbage software that
called it at one time in the past and you can't weed out all of the
calls now.  Since this old subroutine is garbage, it should be avoided
as much as possible.
