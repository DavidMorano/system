PUTHEAP (XXX going to be obsoleted)

This function (subroutine) put a cstring onto a private heap-like
memory area.

This whole function and its very idea is going to be obsoleted
and hopefully lost forever.

If you must: use the subroutine |mallocstr(3uc)| or |mallocstrw(3uc)}.
They are lcoated in the group |mallocstuff(3uc)|.
