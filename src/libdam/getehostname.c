/*******************************************************************************

        This subroutine takes the given name and finds a (possibly new) name
        which is guaranteed to be able to translate to an INET address. If no
        suitable substitute name is found that can be translated into an INET
        addres, a BAD return value is returned. If a suitable name can be found
        that can be translated into a valid INET address, then that name or
        another valid name is returned in the supplied buffer (if one is
        supplied) and an OK value is returned.

	Synopsis:

	int getehostname(name,hostname)
	char	name[] ;
	char	hostname[] ;

	Arguments:

	- name		given name to find a substitute for
	- hostname	a buffer to receive a substitute name (optional) ;
			this can be NULL and no substitute name is returned

	Retruns:

	OK		a valid substitute can be found
	BAD		no valid substitute can be found

	Important note:

        Although this routine may return an OK status to indicate that a valid
        substitute can be found, that does not mean that the original name can
        be translated into an INET address. An OK status only means that this
        subroutine can find a valid substitute. For other INET service
        subroutines which take a hostname type argument, you should always make
        sure that you pass it a name that CAN be translated into an INET
        address, if indeed it can have one as indicated by this subroutine. Got
        it? Good. If not, look at the code carefully and figure out what it is
        trying to test for and do!

        Oh, I almost forgot, a NULL specified name is recognized as the local
        host name.

        Another final note to know is that if a substitute host name can be
        found, and may indeed be returned, it does NOT mean that it is the
        canonical name of the given host. It does not even mean that it may be a
        real good name for the given host. It only means that the substitute
        name can be translated into an INET address which can represent the
        given host. Got that? Good.
