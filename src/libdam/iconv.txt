ICONV

We have two implementations of the ICONV facility (interface). One is from
Solaris® and is the other is from GNU.

The GNU version (somehow) changes referecens from |iconv_xxx| into
|libiconv_xxx| when compiling a module that uses ICONV. So a proper build
requires linking the GNU version of the ICONV library as a consequence.
