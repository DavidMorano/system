VARSUB

This is the (very) famous VARSUB object.  It stands for (quite
famously) Variable-Substitution.  This is a very oldy, but still
very goody object.  This object really dates back (along with the
other very basic objects, such as the various vector-oriented and
other container objects.  This one (VARSUB) kind-of belongs in the
hall-of-fame of objects, if there was such a thing.  Good hunting
... er ... I mean: good coding!
