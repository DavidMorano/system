DISPUTATION OF DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER ON THE POWER AND EFFICACY
OF INDULGENCES

OCTOBER 31, 1517

Out of love for the truth and the desire to bring it to light,
the following propositions will be discussed at Wittenberg,
under the presidency of the Reverend Father Martin Luther,
Master of Arts and of Sacred Theology, and Lecturer in Ordinary
on the same at that place. Wherefore he requests that those who
are unable to be present and debate orally with us, may do so
by letter.

In the Name our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
