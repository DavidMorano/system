2) acquire read-lock on first (and only) byte of file

3) parse file, see if 'status' and 'semaphore' headers are present

4) if our required headers are not there AND if we opened for WRITE
   try to acquire a write-lock

   file with the required headers 

6) release write-lock, re-acquire read-lock and re-parse file
