BBPOSTNOTE

This program is similar to the 'rbbpost' program but instead posts a note to a
newsgroup that is really a MSGS spool directory. This program allows MSGS spool
directories to be treated almost like BBNEWS newsgroup directories. The MSGS
program is actually used to post the note.

Synopsis:
$ bbpostnote <newsgroup< < <input>.msg

Example:
$ bbpostnote <msgs.rc> < <test>.msg
