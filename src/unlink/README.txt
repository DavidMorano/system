UNLINK

This program can be used to unlink those nasty files that you may not
be able to unlink (delete) with the RM program.

For those nasty files:

	unlink -f "filename"

This program can also unlink files at a delayed time from
invocation with something like:

	unlink -d filename

for a default delay or:

	unlink -d=delay filename

for a specific delay.
