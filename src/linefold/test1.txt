1. Schindlers Were Outgunned by Lawyers Early

In case you were wondering, with so many facts in dispute about the
Terri Schiavo case, the answer is relatively clear: The Schindlers,
well-intentioned as they have been, were outgunned in the early legal
fight that sealed their daughter's fate.

The early legal maneuvering created "facts" that are now beyond dispute
in higher courts. One is the unbelievable claim by Michael Schiavo that
Terri wanted to be starved and dehydrated to death.

One Florida attorney told the story on Steve Sailer's Web blog (www.isteve.com).

Here's what the lawyer wrote:

"I have been following the case for years. Something that interests me about the Terri Schiavo case, and that doesn't seem to have gotten much media attention: The whole case rests on the fact that the Schindlers (Terri's parents) were totally outlawyered by the husband (Michael Schiavo) at the trial court level.

"This happened because, in addition to getting a $750K judgment for Terri's medical care, Michael Schiavo individually got a $300K award of damages for loss of consortium, which gave him the money to hire a top-notch lawyer to represent him on the right-to-die claim. He hired George Felos, who specializes in this area and litigated one of the landmark right-to-die cases in Florida in the early '90s.

"By contrast, the Schindlers had trouble even finding a lawyer who would take their case since there was no money in it. Finally they found an inexperienced lawyer who agreed to take it partly out of sympathy for them, but she had almost no resources to work with and no experience in this area of the law. She didn't even depose Michael Schiavo's siblings, who were key witnesses at the trial that decided whether Terri would have wanted to be kept alive. Not surprisingly, Felos steamrollered her.

"The parents obviously had no idea what they were up against until it was too late. It was only after the trial that they started going around to religious and right-to-life groups to tell their story. These organizations were very supportive, but by that point their options were already limited because the trial judge had entered a judgment finding that Terri Schiavo would not have wanted to live.

"This fact is of crucial importance -- and it's one often not fully appreciated by the media, who like to focus on the drama of cases going to the big, powerful appeals courts: Once a trial court enters a judgment into the record, that judgment's findings become THE FACTS of the case, and can only be overturned if the fact finder (in this case, the judge) acted capriciously (i.e., reached a conclusion that had essentially no basis in fact).

"In this case, the trial judge simply chose to believe Michael Schiavo's version of the facts over the Schindlers'. Since there was evidence to support his conclusion (in the form of testimony from Michael Schiavo's siblings), it became nearly impossible for the Schindlers to overturn it. The judges who considered the case after the trial-level proceeding could make decisions only on narrow questions of law. They had no room to ask, "Hey, wait a minute, would she really want to die?" That "fact" had already been decided.

"In essence, the finding that Terri Schiavo would want to die came down to the subjective opinion of one overworked trial judge who was confronted by a very sharp, experienced right-to-die attorney on one side and a young, quasi-pro bono lawyer on the other.

"Nothing unusual about this, of course. It's the kind of thing that happens all the time. But it's an interesting point to keep in mind when you read that the Schiavo case has been litigated for years and has been reviewed by dozens of judges ... yadda yadda yadda.

"By the way, I'm guessing that George Felos is probably quite happy to work the Schiavo case for free at this point since it's making him one of the most famous right-to-kill -- I mean right-to-die -- lawyers in the country. His BlackBerry has probably melted down by now, what with all the messages from the hurry-up-and-die adult children you've been blogging about."


2. Michael Schiavo Attacks Jeb Bush

Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has done more than most to save the life of Terri Schiavo, a 41-year-old brain-damaged woman who was essentially ordered to die by a state judge.

Many appreciate the governor's efforts. But Terri's husband, Michael, isn't one of them.

Following a court's decision ordering doctors to remove Terri's feeding tube March 18, Bush contacted federal lawmakers, telling them his hands were tied because further state legislative efforts to keep her nourished had failed and weren't looking any better.

The federal lawmakers, mostly Republicans, got the ball rolling and in an unprecedented feat of political mastery, both houses of Congress managed to pass legislation allowing Terri's parents to ask a federal judge to order that she be fed. President Bush, Jeb's older brother, immediately signed the bill.

But on ABC's "Nightline" program last week, Michael Schiavo blasted the governor and Congress for their "interference," accusing them of doing what they did only "to win votes."

Regarding Jeb Bush, Schiavo said that to him it was incomprehensible "for a governor to come into this without any education on the subject and push his personal views."

Michael Schiavo says his wife at one time told him she didn't want to be kept alive. But his claims about her statement were made some seven years after she was hospitalized. 

Jeb Bush and congressional Republicans were right to try to save Terri's life.



3. Hillary Allies Commandeering Key Party Posts

Democratic Sen. Hillary Clinton continues to deny that she is interested in a bid for the White House in 2008. But if you look around at changes taking place within her party, you might not believe her.

The Washington Post reports that Friends of Hillary are cropping up in key posts at the Democratic National Committee and other DNC-friendly organizations.

For instance, the paper reported, Harold Ickes -- longtime Democratic operative and friend -- has taken the helm at America Coming Together, an influential labor organization. 

Also, Howard Wolfson, another friend, is "taking on a contract to shape strategy at the state Democratic Party in New York," the paper reported.

And Howard Dean, head of the DNC, has replaced Jano Cabrera as communications director with Karen Finney, who served as deputy press secretary in the first lady's office during the Clinton years. Finney also served as Hillary's spokeswoman during the former's successful Senate bid in 2000. 

Finally, Mike Gehrke is replacing the DNC's research director, Jason Miner. Gehrke once worked in the Clinton White House. He then lent his research skills to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee later on.

4. 'Mein Kampf' a Best Seller

Another worrisome sign is the growing anti-Semitism in Turkey.

Turkey has been a strong U.S. ally and a friend of Israel. But in recent years, fundamentalist Islam has been growing there.

Now, years after the fall of Nazi Germany, Turkish bookshops are reporting that Adolf Hitler's book "Mein Kampf" ("My Struggle") is a best seller.

The book, "filled with anti-Jewish diatribes and dreams of world domination, is puzzling some Turks," The Associated Press reports. Some wonder if sales of the book are reflective of a rising anti-Semitic attitude, or perhaps a demonstration of anger over Israel's handling of the Palestinians.

Others question whether it is a rebellion against Turkish efforts to join the European Union, or if it just offers "a cheap thrill," AP reported.

Two new versions of the book are currently out in paperback and selling for about $4.50. However, AP says there could be some legal ramifications ahead. 

The books "were printed without the permission of the Finance Ministry of the German state of Bavaria, which was given control of Hitler's estate after World War II and is keen to suppress the book."

Officials there say they restrict the granting of copyrights to the book because they don't want to spread Nazi ideals.

The book, written in the 1920s, has been available in Arab countries for many years but there has been no increases in sales, says AP.



5. Staged Dan Rather Interview?

After having one of his worst years in broadcasting, there is more disturbing news about former "CBS Evening News" anchor Dan Rather.

According to a report in Human Events, author Humberto Fontova says Rather's interview with Juan Miguel Gonzales, the father of Elian Gonzales, "was stage-managed by former Clinton lawyer and friend, Gregory Craig."

Fontova, who makes his assertions in his new book, "Fidel: Hollywood's Favorite Tyrant," wrote, according to a Cuban American translator: "The questions for Juan Miguel were actually fed to Dan Rather by Gregory Craig. 

"After a taping session, Craig would call Dan over, give him some more instructions, and exchange papers with him. Then Dan would come back on the set and ask those."

Craig behaved like a movie director, Fontova says, "and even got a bona fide dramatic actor to translate and mouth the responses of Miguel," Human Events reported.

Another Dan Rather deception? You decide.

6. Will Hillary Follow Ickes on 527s?

Harold Ickes, one of Sen. Hillary Clinton's closest advisers, has ascended to the helm of America Coming Together (ACT), a so-called "527" group whose political advocacy could help the junior New York Democrat become president in 2008.

That's long-term. For now, however, the ascension of Ickes is a problem for Clinton because "in the next few months," the paper says, she "may have to vote on whether Mr. Ickes' organization ... will, in essence, be put out of business."

That's because Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russ Feingold, D-Wis., original sponsors of 2002's campaign finance reform law, are proposing new legislation that would close a loophole in the law restricting operations of the 527 groups (so named for a section of the tax code under which they were formed).

Ickes -- campaign manager for Clinton's 2000 Senate bid -- and ACT are heading up the opposition to the bill. But Clinton voted for the McCain-Feingold bill, leading some to believe she may also support this new campaign reform effort.

If she does, however -- and the bill ultimately passes -- she may be helping to destroy a group that could become her best political ally in any bid for the White House.

Right now, "nobody knows whether she's signed on," one Senate staffer following the issue told the Sun.

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Finally, Mike Gehrke is replacing the DNC's research director, Jason Miner. Gehrke once worked in the Clinton White House. He then lent his research skills to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee later on.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. 'Mein Kampf' a Best Seller<BR></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Another worrisome sign is the growing anti-Semitism in Turkey.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Turkey has been a strong U.S. ally and a friend of Israel. But in recent years, fundamentalist Islam&nbsp;has been&nbsp;growing there.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Now, years after the fall of Nazi Germany, Turkish bookshops are reporting that Adolf Hitler's book "Mein Kampf" ("My Struggle") is a best seller.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The book, "filled with anti-Jewish diatribes and dreams of world domination, is puzzling some Turks," The Associated Press reports. Some wonder if sales of the book are reflective of a rising anti-Semitic attitude, or perhaps a demonstration of anger over Israel's handling of the Palestinians.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Others question whether it is a rebellion against Turkish efforts to join the European Union, or if it just offers "a cheap thrill," AP reported.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Two new versions of the book are currently out in paperback and selling for about $4.50. However, AP says there could be some legal ramifications ahead. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The books "were printed without the permission of the Finance Ministry of the German state of Bavaria, which was given control of Hitler's estate after World War II and is keen to suppress the book."</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Officials there say they restrict the granting of copyrights to the book because they don't want to spread Nazi ideals.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The book,&nbsp;written in the 1920s, has been available in Arab countries for many years but there has been no increases in sales, says AP.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>5. Staged Dan Rather Interview?</FONT></STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial>After having one of his worst years in broadcasting, there is more disturbing news about former "CBS Evening News" anchor Dan Rather.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial>According to a report in Human Events, author Humberto Fontova says Rather's interview with Juan Miguel Gonzales, the father of Elian Gonzales, "was stage-managed by former Clinton lawyer and friend, Gregory Craig."</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial>Fontova, who makes his assertions in his new book, "Fidel: Hollywood's Favorite Tyrant," wrote, according to a Cuban American translator: "The questions for Juan Miguel were actually fed to Dan Rather by Gregory Craig. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial>"After a taping session, Craig would call Dan over, give him some more instructions, and exchange papers with him. Then Dan would come back on the set and ask those."</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial>Craig behaved like a movie director, Fontova says, "and even got a bona fide dramatic actor to translate and mouth the responses of Miguel," Human Events reported.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial>Another Dan Rather deception? You decide.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2><STRONG><FONT face=Arial>6. Will Hillary Follow Ickes on 527s?</FONT></STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial>Harold Ickes, one of Sen. Hillary Clinton's closest advisers, has ascended to the helm of America Coming Together (ACT), a so-called "527" group whose political advocacy could help the junior New York Democrat become president in 2008.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial>That's long-term. For now, however, the ascension of Ickes is a problem for Clinton because "in the next few months," the paper says, she "may have to vote on whether Mr. Ickes' organization ... will, in essence, be put out of business."</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial>That's because Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russ Feingold, D-Wis., original sponsors of 2002's campaign finance reform law, are proposing new legislation that would close a loophole in the law restricting operations of the 527 groups (so named for a section of the tax code under which they were formed).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial>Ickes&nbsp;-- campaign manager for Clinton's 2000 Senate bid&nbsp;-- and ACT are heading up the opposition to the bill. But Clinton voted for the McCain-Feingold bill, leading some to believe she may also support this new campaign reform effort.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial>If she does, however -- and the bill ultimately passes&nbsp;-- she may be helping to destroy a group that could become her best political ally in any bid for the White House.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial>Right now, "nobody knows whether she's signed on," one Senate staffer following the issue told the Sun.</FONT></P></FONT></td>
