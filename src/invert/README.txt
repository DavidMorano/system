INVERT

This is a line inverting program. It is used as an embedded utility for several
other programs.

This program uses a very fast algorithm but seems to have some bugs in it. (Why
do the fast algorithms always have the bugs?)

Further, it is found (as one of the program's bugs) that this program is not
robust at all in the face of non-line coded input files. If a binary file is
given as input to this program, totally unpredictable behavior results including
this program hanging indefitely! What is this all about? Your guess is as good
as mine (and I wrote this program)!

For what it is worth, this program usually works fine, and very fast, for
regular line coded input.
