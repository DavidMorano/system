# COMMANDMENTS

#
# This is the COMMANDMENTS database.  This database is wholly in text
# and should contain a list of commandments.  Each commandment consists of
# one or more lines of text started with a commandment-introducer number
# on a new line by itself.  The commandment-instroducer number should
# be a positive decimal number at the beginning of a line of text and
# terminated by a period character.  Commandments are terminated by the
# introduction of a new commandment or an empty line.  Comments in this
# file can be introduced by the pound ('#') character starting a line (not
# necessarily in the first column by but any non-white-space characters).
# 
# An optional number-zero commandment is allowed but its use is
# unspecified.

and do all thy work: But the seventh day [is] the sabbath of the LORD
thy God: [in it] thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy
daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy
stranger that [is] within thy gates: For [in] six days the LORD made
heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them [is], and rested the
seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.
