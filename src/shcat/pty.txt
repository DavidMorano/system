NAME
  pty - create pseudo terminal and run command

SYNOPSIS
  pty [ options ] command [arg ...]

DESCRIPTION
  pty creates a pseudo pty and then runs command with arguments given by arg
  and the standard input, standard output, and standard error connected to the
  pseudo terminal. By default, the pty creates a new session.

  If command does not contain a /, the PATH variable will be used to locate the
  command.

  Input to pty will be written to the standard input of this command. The
  standard output and standard error from the command will be written to the
  standard output of pty.

  The pty commmand terminates when the command completes.

OPTIONS
  -d, --dialogue  Execute the dialogue on the standard input. A dialogue is a
                  sequence of commands, one command per line. All re patterns
                  are extended regular expressions. The re ?1 will print the
                  subject string on the standard error and match the string;
                  the re ?0 will print the subject string on the standard error
                  and not match the string. The re ?. matches EOF. The commands
                  are:
                    # comment
                          comment line
                    d milliseconds
                          set the delay before each master write to
                          milliseconds; the default is no delay
                    i re  read a line from the master; if it matches re then
                          execute lines until matching e or f
                    e [re]
                          else [if match re] then execute lines until matching
                          e or f
                    f     end of i/e block
                    m text
                          write text to the standard error
                    p text
                          peek input until text is found at the beginning of a
                          line; input is not consumed
                    r [re]
                          read a line from the master [and it should match re]
                    s milliseconds
                          sleep for milliseconds
                    t milliseconds
                          set the master read timout to milliseconds; the
                          default is 1000
                    v level
                          set the verbose trace level, more output for higher
                          levels, disabled for level 0
                    w text
                          write text to the master; C style escapes in text are
                          converted, including \E for ESC and \cX for control-X
                    x [code
                          exit pty with exit code 0 [code]
                    I re  ignore master lines matching re
                    L label
                          prefix all diagnostics with label:
                    P [text]
                          delay each master write until the beginning of an
                          unread input line exactly matches text
  -m, --messages=file
                  Redirect diagnostic message output to file.
  -s, --session   Create a separate session for the process started by pty. On
                  by default; -s means --nosession.
  -t, --timeout=milliseconds
                  Set the master read timeout to milliseconds. The default
                  value is 1000.
  -T, --tty=stty  Pass stty to the stty(1) command to initialize the pty.
  -v, --verbose[=level]
                  Set the verbose trace level, more output for higher levels,
                  disabled for level 0. The option value may be omitted.
  -w, --delay=milliseconds
                  Set the delay before each master write to milliseconds. The
                  default value is 0.

EXIT STATUS
  If the command determined by command is run the exit status of pty is that of
  this command. Otherwise, the exit status is one of the following:
    127   The command is found but cannot be executed.
    128   The command could not be found.
