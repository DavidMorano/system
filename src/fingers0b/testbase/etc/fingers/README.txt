FINGERS


This directory is searched (among other places) for configuration
information for the FINGERS (Finger Server) program if it is
configured to use this distribution tree as its program root.

Defaults are applied for about everything but configuration files found
here will be used in the default case and when alternate configuration
information is not provided at program invocation.
