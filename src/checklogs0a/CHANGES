CHECKLOGS


= version 0, 94/05/01, Dave Morano

The program was originally written but was adapted in the log table
file format from the early Automation Test days, circa 1991 maybe.
Of course, as always, code was taken from where ever to start this
program from one that may have been most similar to it !


= version 0a, 94/05/08, Dave Morano

The program was enhanced to add some summary output to the program's
log file about how many files were encountered, how many were checked,
and how many were found to have been oversized.
