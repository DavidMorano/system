1) Receives location updates from various listening sources and
   logs the updates in the location-DB.

2) Optionally polls the local and remote systems (using 'dialcprog(3d)')
   for location updates.

3) Receives requests for location-change notifications and registers
   these in a DB.

4) Sends out location-change notifications for previous registered requests.



= Update Message

The sub-type of the UPDATE message is one of:

+ login
+ logout
+ update terminal times

Additional fields should include:

+ nodename
+ domainname
+ username
+ log-line or terminal-line (if not logged in)
+ log-id
+ log-host
+ session process ID
+ realname
+ terminal-type

The UPDATE message status should also include:

a) whether there is a UTMPX entry or not for current session
b) "message" status of current terminal
c) "biff" status of current terminal

If there is no controlling terminal for the session, don't send the
update message.

If there is no UTMPX entry, check if there is a controlling terminal
by attempting to open '/dev/tty'.  If that fails, there isn't any
controlling terminal.  If that succeeds, it is not clear how to find
the associated terminal device name.
