UNLINKD (unfinished)

This is the UNLINKD daemon program. It is very simple. You run this with an
argument, and the argument gets deleted in a few seconds. If you give a second
argument, the first argument (as a file) gets deleted in the number of seconds
specified by the second argument.

It also can work in "input" mode. Without arguments, it will read its standard
input for filename/delay_time pairs, one per line.
