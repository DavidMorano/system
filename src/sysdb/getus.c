/*******************************************************************************

	These subroutines were was written to provide a more consistent
	interface to the system 'user-shells" database.

	These subroutines are multi-thread safe, because the underlying
	subroutines are themselves multi-thread safe.

	Although safe for multithreading, different threads using these
	subroutines at the same time will enumerate separate subsets of the
	accessed database.  This is the way the UNIX® gods seemed to want these
	sorts of subroutines to work (did they really have a choice given that
	these existed before multi-threading came into vogue?).
