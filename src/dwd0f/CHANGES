Directory Watcher Daemon (DWD)


= version 0a
	96/11/01, Dave Morano

This is the first version to go into service.  This program was written
for service as part of the Personal Communication Services (PCS)
package but is general enough for any other uses.


= version 0b
	97/06/01, Dave Morano

1) This version is slightly enhanced to only execute a maximum number
   of jobs simultaneously.  This is necessary to minimize the impact on
   the system when a large number of jobs are accumulated like for example
   just after a prolonged down time of the machine.

2) This version also adds support for expanding out the following
   keys in the configuration file :
	N	node
	D	domain
	H	host
	R	program root
	V	program version

   This version also adds the key :
	R	program root

   to the expansion of the service table file "arguments" entries.

3) This program can also now be 'what'ed to print out
   its version string stored internally in the 'what' format.


= version 0c
	98/06/22, Dave Morano

1) This version is slightly enhanced to be compatible with the
   latest (1995) POSIX standard for use with threads.
   This affected most all previous (in draft) versions of the
   thread-safe POSIX subroutines !  (Yes, I am angry with POSIX
   for changing so many of the thread safe interfaces !)

2) This version adds support for expanding out the basic keys
   described above for the "program" entry of the service table
   also.

3) The check for whether a program is possibly executable or
   not has been put back in.  We supposedly now have a "good" solution
   to when the daemon program (that is not really executable) gets
   'exec'ed and then goes on to fail.  The code is supposed to queue up
   the bad job waiting for a 'srvtab' change but this somehow gets lost
   in the code (because this code now is a real bad hack !).

   Extra Note:  This code was a real hack from the start.  It is not
   modular enough to really want to try and enhance at all.  A rewrite
   should be considered if more robustness or enhancements are wanted.


= version 0d
	98/12/22, Dave Morano

1) Well here we go again exactly 6 months later than the previous version.
   I think that there was a core dump but I could not find it !


= version 0e
	99/07/24, Dave Morano

1) We want to ensure that files without servers STAY in the directory
   properly and are re-executed later after JOBRETRYTIME.  As far as I
   know, this is not being done and has not been fixed here.  The fact
   that these last two looks (this one and the previous one) did not
   actually change anything is an indication that this code is ready
   for the bit bucket because it is too difficult to either fix or
   enhance !


= version 0f
	00/04/21, Dave Morano

1) I added an argument option ('-p') that indicates a new poll-only mode
   of operation.  The idea is that the daemon will only run for a
   certain amount of time after there are no more jobs to process.
   (This is only the first successful attempt at an enhancement
   since 98/06/22 !)
