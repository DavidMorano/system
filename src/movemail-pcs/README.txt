MOVEMAIL-PCS

This is a (very) cheap and dirty MOVEMAIL for PCS to serve as a place
holder for all of the other MOVEMAILs that

	DO NOT WORK!!

Most MOVEMAILs were created for the secutiry challanged and broken BSD
systems!  This MOVEMAIL at least knows about standard UNIX System V
(the original) mail locking protocol and will use it.
