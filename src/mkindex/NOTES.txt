MKINDEX

This program does very much what the MKINV program does. It creates a set of
files that serve as an index for input files specified through "tags" created
from a program like MKKEY.

The index files creates are:

	<name>.post
	<name>.names

These two files serve the purpose of the TAGS and HASH files from the MKKEY and
then the MKINV programs.


Philosophy of Implementation

The algorithm to produce the index is based on the idea that the
index can be stored in a memory mapped file and that it can be updated
(augmented) in that state before being finalized and unmapped, and closed.
An object used to manipulate the memory mapped file is termed MEMFILE.
This object facilitates low overhead writing to the file while the
mapping allows fast reading and updating.


Future Experiments

An experiment, apparently purely hypothetical, was started whereby to create an
object that could process a POST file (whatever exactly that is). The
experimental object was termed POSTFILE.
