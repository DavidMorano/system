RENAME

Implementation strategy:

1) get the list of files to be renamed

2) find a filename prefix that is free in the current directory

3) create the list of new file names that would be created

4) rename any existing files that have the same name as one listed from (3)
   to a name with the prefix determined from (2); change the source
   name from (1) to the new name created here

5) rename the source list to the final names
