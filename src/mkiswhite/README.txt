MKISWHITE

This program makes a C-language fragment that consists of an array of
characters. Elements of the array are set to zero or non-zero according to
whether the array is indexed by a character that is white-space or not. A NL
(new-line) character is not considered "white-space" for the purposes of this
facility.
