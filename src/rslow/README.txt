Remote Slow (RSLOW)

This is the Remote Slow store-and-forward utility. This version is the newer
only-use-INET-and-TCP-transport version! Yes, older versions used other
transports and chose them dynamically also! However, the world is changing and
we have to stay up with it. The world only uses TCP over INET now and we need to
get in line or be squashed!
