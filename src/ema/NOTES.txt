EMA

This program extracts EMAs from message headers.

For example:

$ ema -h to < file.msg

would extrat all of the EMAs associated with "to" headers.  The default
is to extract all of the "to" addresses!

The following will extract all subparts of an address including the EMA:

$ ema -s address,comment,route -h to < file.msg


option		description
--------------------------------------------

-s <what>	selects a component of the address (separated by '|');
		<what> can be:
			address, route, comment, best
		default is "route"

-h <header>	extracts addresses from this header; default is "to"

-info		create and informational report


Maybe in the future:

	$ ema -h to=route,from=comment < file.msg

	$ ema -h to=(r,a),from=c < file.msg
