# SATconfig database configuration table file

#	SAMPLE SAT_CONFIG CONFIGURATION FILE

# NOTES:
#
#	Remember that 'GTDEV' is the line which goes to the switch
#	SAT connection.  'GTDEV2' is the line which goes between the
#	computer and the terminal (shadow SAT) itself.
#
#	All command line arguments have precedence over any corresponding
#	arguments in this configuration file.  The entries in this file
#	do not have any special order.  Defaults are applied in a
#	defined sequence which is independent of the order of defaults
#	in this file.
#

# lines are of the general form :
#
#	key	any_further_arguments
#
# possible keys and their meanings are :
#
#	control		- controlling lock area directory
#	log		- file path name for the log file
#	filter		- file path name for the SAT filter file
#	mapping		- file path name for the SAT mapping file
#	diction		- file path name for the SAT diction file
#	export		- environment variable & value to be exported
#	system		- a SAT system description entry
#	library		- path to library directory
#	function	- create a function to perform
#	default		- default system name
#	release		- default SUT release
#	workdir		- working directory
#	wait		- lock file wait time out
#
#
#	There is no order to any entries in this file.  Entries may appear
#	in any order and are still used the same (as for defaults et cetera).
#	The following lines specify system defaults for certain files or
#	directories.  Entries starting with an 'e' are to be exported into
#	the environment.  An unused (or unspecified) field should contain a '-'
#	character.


# the following lines specify defaults for the program

def	v5d9				# default system name

log	/mt/mtgzy/agy6/dam/src/satconfig/con/satlog
lib	/mt/mtgzy/agy6/dam/src/satconfig/lib
filter	default.f		# default filter file (cploc)
map	default.m		# default mapping file
dict	default.d		# default dictionary file
wait	200			# lock file wait timeout

# additional variables to be exported into the environment

exp	SAT_POLL_DIR = /usr/sat/lib/parsers


# environment variable 'A_RELEASE' takes precedence over next entry

rel	g1v5b10_0			# default SW release for automation


# The following lines are 'system' description lines and are of the form :
#
#  sys sys_name	GTDEV		GTDEV2 	filter mapping diction
#
# Filter, Mapping, and Diction file entries are optional and if not
# specified, any defaults listed in this file will be used instead.

# complex functions

#	These lines take the form :
#
#		f type function	commands_string
#
#	Where type is one or more of :
#		-	(or null) means don't do anything special
#		l	program requires system lock (typical)
#		r	check argument for readability
#		w	check argument for writability
#
#	The following substitutions are made on command strings :
#		%a	file name argument
#		%s	system name
#		%f	SAT filter file
#		%m	SAT mapping file
#		%d	SAT dictionary file
#		%l	library directory
#		%c	control lock directory
#		%w	working directory
#		%r	SUT release
