SATCONFIG

This is the old program that facilitates SAT configuration (in some way). What
was the SAT? I think it was something like System Administrative Terminal.
The so-called "configuration" was something related to creating (basically)
an index file for use in accessing to performing configuration on the SAT.
Beyond this, I forget.  Read the code or other sources for more information.
Finally, check out the SATTAB file for clues.

Yes, I wrote this, but whew! It was a while ago.
