DMAIL

This is the mail delivery program for the PCS mailer system.

Call just like normal mail:

$ dmail [-d] [-f fromaddr] username [username2 [...]] [-m]


This program is written to try to be as tolerant as possible for poorly
administered mail systems.  Some features coded into the program to
help alleviate mail problems are:

+ when run set-user-id to 'root', the program will work correctly

+ when using a System V style mail scheme, the program will work
correctly if it has set-group-id to group 'mail'

+ when running the system without the stupid POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED
mode, the program will be able to create a mailfile for another user if
it has write permission to the mail spool area

+ observes all known mail locking schemes as well as some extra
safe-guards for stupid other mail programs that may be around in the
system

+ the program will try to find a mail spool area when the MAIL
environment variable is either not set or is set to a directory that is
not writable

For best results, set the program to BOTH set-user-id to 'root' AND
set-group-id to 'mail'.
