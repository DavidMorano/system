AGridM 2003: Workshop on Adaptive Grid Middleware

Organizers:
Wilson Rivera and Jaime Seguel, University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez, USA


Scope:
Grid computing research focuses on building a large-scale
computing infrastructure by linking computing facilities at many
distributed locations. By analogy with the electric power Grids, such
systems are known as computational Grids. Significant effort has been
spent in the design and implementation of middleware software for enabling
computational Grids. These software packages have been successfully
deployed and it is now possible to build clusters beyond the boundaries
of a single local area network. However, the challenging problem of
dynamically allocating resources in response to application requests for
computational services remains unsolved. Adaptive middleware is software
that resides between the application and the computer operating system and
enables an application to adapt to changing availability of computing and
networking resources.

The purpose of this workshop is to provide an open forum for researchers
from hardware and software areas to present, discuss, and exchange
research-related ideas, results, and experiences in the area of adaptive
middleware for computational Grids.

COLP 2003: Workshop on Compilers and Operating Systems for Low Power

Organizers:
Diana Marculescu, Carnegie Mellon University, USA and
J. Ramanujam, Louisiana State University, USA


Scope:
Power consumption has increasingly become important in computer
systems. Current designs of processor cores are predicting power
figures above 100 Watts. The management of power consumption while
simultaneously delivering acceptable levels of performance is
becoming a critical task with the proliferation of application
domains such as wireless communication and embedded signal
processing. In addition, it has become increasingly important to
manage power consumption in high-performance, general purpose
microarchitectures. It has been forecast that, without significant
advances in design for low power, processors of the future will
consume hundreds of watts of power. We believe that a synergistic
hardware-software approach is required. A lot of attention has been
paid to optimizing power at the circuit and gate levels. Recently,
power optimizations at the architecture and software (i.e., compiler,
operating system, and application) level have begun to receive
increasing attention. The purpose of this workshop is to draw
together researchers and practitioners concerned with compiler and
operating system support for low power for a stimulating exchange
of views. Presentations from invited speakers from both the industry
and academia will provide insights into emerging issues related to
this area of research.

MEDEA 2003: MEmory performance: DEaling with Applications, systems and
            architectures

Organizers:
Sandro Bartolini, University of Siena, Italy
Pierfrancesco Foglia and Cosimo Antonio Prete, University of Pisa, Italy


Scope:
MEDEA-2003 aims to continue the high level of interest in the
first three MEDEA Workshops held with PACT'00, PACT'01 and PACT'02.

Due to the ever-increasing gap between CPU and memory speed, there is a
great interest in evaluating and proposing processor, multiprocessor and
system architectures dealing with the "memory wall" problem. In this
scenario, memory performance issues can be better addressed when
considering system architecture and application domain in a joint manner.
In fact, it is the combined effect of the applications and the system on
which they are executing that stresses the memory subsystem and pushes
towards specific solutions. Typical architectural choices include single
processor vs. multiprocessor solutions, single chip vs. COTS design,
superscalar, multithreaded or VLIW architectures. Application domains
encompass commercial (Web, DB, e-business, and multimedia), embedded
(personal, mobile, automotive, automation and medical), networking
applications, etc.

The MEDEA-2003 Workshop wants to be a forum for academic and industrial
people to meet, discuss and exchange their ideas and experience on the
design and evaluation of architectures for embedded, commercial and
general purpose systems. Main topics are memory performance issues and
solutions in the various application domains.

SNAPI 2003: Workshop on Storage Network Architecture and Parallel I/Os

Organizer:
Qing (Ken) Yang, University of Rhode Island, USA


Scope:
Data are the "life-blood" of computing and the main asset of any
organization. Therefore, disk I/O and data storage on which data reside
are becoming "first class citizens" in today's information world. This
workshop intends to bring together researchers and practitioners from
academia and industry to discuss cutting edge research on parallel and
distributed data storage technologies. By discussing ongoing research,
the workshop will expose participants to the most recent developments
in storage network architectures and parallel I/O.


Workshop webpage:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


SPDSEC 2003: Workshop on Hardware/Software Support for Parallel and
Distributed Scientific and Engineering Computing

Organizers:
Minyi Guo, University of Aizu, Japan
Laurence Tianruo Yang, Francis Xavier University, Canada


Scope:
The field of parallel and distributed processing has obtained
prominence through advances in electronic and integrated technologies
beginning in the 1940s. Current times are very exciting and the years
to come will witness a proliferation in the use of parallel and distributed
systems, or supercomputers. The scientific and engineering application
domains have a key role in shaping future research and development
activities in academia and industry.

The purpose of this workshop is to provide an open forum for computer
scientists, computational scientists and engineers, applied mathematicians,
and researchers to present, discuss, and exchange research-related ideas,
results, works-in-progress, and experiences in the areas of architectural,
compilation, and language support for problems in science and engineering
applications.

AGridM 2003: Workshop on Adaptive Grid Middleware

Organizers:
Wilson Rivera and Jaime Seguel, University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez, USA


Scope:
Grid computing research focuses on building a large-scale
computing infrastructure by linking computing facilities at many
distributed locations. By analogy with the electric power Grids, such
systems are known as computational Grids. Significant effort has been
spent in the design and implementation of middleware software for enabling
computational Grids. These software packages have been successfully
deployed and it is now possible to build clusters beyond the boundaries
of a single local area network. However, the challenging problem of
dynamically allocating resources in response to application requests for
computational services remains unsolved. Adaptive middleware is software
that resides between the application and the computer operating system and
enables an application to adapt to changing availability of computing and
networking resources.

The purpose of this workshop is to provide an open forum for researchers
from hardware and software areas to present, discuss, and exchange
research-related ideas, results, and experiences in the area of adaptive
middleware for computational Grids.

COLP 2003: Workshop on Compilers and Operating Systems for Low Power

Organizers:
Diana Marculescu, Carnegie Mellon University, USA and
J. Ramanujam, Louisiana State University, USA


Scope:
Power consumption has increasingly become important in computer
systems. Current designs of processor cores are predicting power
figures above 100 Watts. The management of power consumption while
simultaneously delivering acceptable levels of performance is
becoming a critical task with the proliferation of application
domains such as wireless communication and embedded signal
processing. In addition, it has become increasingly important to
manage power consumption in high-performance, general purpose
microarchitectures. It has been forecast that, without significant
advances in design for low power, processors of the future will
consume hundreds of watts of power. We believe that a synergistic
hardware-software approach is required. A lot of attention has been
paid to optimizing power at the circuit and gate levels. Recently,
power optimizations at the architecture and software (i.e., compiler,
operating system, and application) level have begun to receive
increasing attention. The purpose of this workshop is to draw
together researchers and practitioners concerned with compiler and
operating system support for low power for a stimulating exchange
of views. Presentations from invited speakers from both the industry
and academia will provide insights into emerging issues related to
this area of research.

MEDEA 2003: MEmory performance: DEaling with Applications, systems and
            architectures

Organizers:
Sandro Bartolini, University of Siena, Italy
Pierfrancesco Foglia and Cosimo Antonio Prete, University of Pisa, Italy


Scope:
MEDEA-2003 aims to continue the high level of interest in the
first three MEDEA Workshops held with PACT'00, PACT'01 and PACT'02.

Due to the ever-increasing gap between CPU and memory speed, there is a
great interest in evaluating and proposing processor, multiprocessor and
system architectures dealing with the "memory wall" problem. In this
scenario, memory performance issues can be better addressed when
considering system architecture and application domain in a joint manner.
In fact, it is the combined effect of the applications and the system on
which they are executing that stresses the memory subsystem and pushes
towards specific solutions. Typical architectural choices include single
processor vs. multiprocessor solutions, single chip vs. COTS design,
superscalar, multithreaded or VLIW architectures. Application domains
encompass commercial (Web, DB, e-business, and multimedia), embedded
(personal, mobile, automotive, automation and medical), networking
applications, etc.

The MEDEA-2003 Workshop wants to be a forum for academic and industrial
people to meet, discuss and exchange their ideas and experience on the
design and evaluation of architectures for embedded, commercial and
general purpose systems. Main topics are memory performance issues and
solutions in the various application domains.

SNAPI 2003: Workshop on Storage Network Architecture and Parallel I/Os

Organizer:
Qing (Ken) Yang, University of Rhode Island, USA


Scope:
Data are the "life-blood" of computing and the main asset of any
organization. Therefore, disk I/O and data storage on which data reside
are becoming "first class citizens" in today's information world. This
workshop intends to bring together researchers and practitioners from
academia and industry to discuss cutting edge research on parallel and
distributed data storage technologies. By discussing ongoing research,
the workshop will expose participants to the most recent developments
in storage network architectures and parallel I/O.


Workshop webpage:
http://www.ele.uri.edu/tcca/SNAPI_CFP.html


---------------------------------------------------------------------------


SPDSEC 2003: Workshop on Hardware/Software Support for Parallel and
Distributed Scientific and Engineering Computing

Organizers:
Minyi Guo, University of Aizu, Japan
Laurence Tianruo Yang, Francis Xavier University, Canada


Scope:
The field of parallel and distributed processing has obtained
prominence through advances in electronic and integrated technologies
beginning in the 1940s. Current times are very exciting and the years
to come will witness a proliferation in the use of parallel and distributed
systems, or supercomputers. The scientific and engineering application
domains have a key role in shaping future research and development
activities in academia and industry.

The purpose of this workshop is to provide an open forum for computer
scientists, computational scientists and engineers, applied mathematicians,
and researchers to present, discuss, and exchange research-related ideas,
results, works-in-progress, and experiences in the areas of architectural,
compilation, and language support for problems in science and engineering
applications.

Thanks Dave,

I have got to send this in before I leave.

Hi Rob,

I have been carefully considering what might be the best prospectus. 
The following is a skeletal outline of a more sophisticated plan. I 
would prefer to get into greater detail after we agree to join 
forces.  :)

I agree that the Latina community's needs should be addressed first. 
Therefore I propose:

Initial Phase:
Transition - Entrainment and in depth understanding of this 
operation,  the marketing area and its demographics
Translation - Translation of local documents for community dissemination
Research - Local area targeting, contact and materials preparation

Second Phase:
Grant Proposals - Conceptualizing grants and targets
Multi-level advertising, targeting and contacts - Includes field operations

Third Phase:
Coordination and continued field operations

(Additional or intersticial levels would be discussed between us.)

I will work from my office. We will be in daily contact, meeting as 
needed.  I will use all my own materials and equipment (computer, 
laptop, car, phone, cell, fax, paper etc.)

I think that a fair amount to ask is: $35,000 a year paid bi-weekly, 
plus profit sharing.

I will work selflessly and tirelessly to see this operation grow succesfully.

I hope that this plan is amenable, I have tried to make this as clear 
and concise as possible.

I will make it worth your while.

Thanks.

Eve Silver

>A.  General education to all regarding eldercare and senior issues.

>B.  Overcoming the linguistic barriers for both clients and potential

>elderly who do not speak English as the original language are less likely to
>have acclimated to English than the younger generations.  As a result, they
>"miss the boat" on several eldercare opportunities.
>
>C.  Overcoming the background check dilemmas for  potential caregivers.
>Morally I owe every client an affirmative statement that the background of
>the caregiver has been reviewed.  I am not comfortable with anything else.
>
>D.  Networking with a host of different groups, resources, etc.  The list is
>incredible -- and I have not had the time to develop a decent plan or
>implement it.  I do try to function under the basic premise of "plan your
>work and work your plan,"  but nearly all of my time is spent on day to day
>activities and issues.
>
>E.  Translating locally generated documents  and, hopefully, some of the
>nationally generated documents.
>
>F.  Identifying ways CK can grow over time.  Even the most successful
>business will fail if it becomes stale or relies on its past reputation.  I
>think this ties into the "Certified Senior Advisor" training that I
>completed.  (Not sure I told you about this.)
>
>G. Implementing a useful quality assessment and feedback system. I am
>confident that we do a very good job overall, but at the same time I know
>that seniors, for the most part, are very gracious and will not raise
>concerns or complaints.  In addition, it is much easer to deal with a little
>issue shortly after it happens than a larger issue that has grown and
>festered over time.
>
>H.  Find ways to improve the fiscal efficiency in the business.  This does
>not take an appreciation of numbers but an ability to understand procedural
>relationships and the effectiveness of the work being done.   I suppose this
>could be encapsulated in the phrase "performance audit" rather than "fiscal
>audit."  There is always a better "mouse trap" waiting to be invented.  I
>can assure you that reduction in non-personnel costs will result in an
>increase in personnel costs as we fight to obtain an honorable wage for
>those who care for our loved ones.

NO one. Even I do not see me through your eyes.

  Nobody appreciates me as you do my David.

Always.
