MKTOFC (Make To Fold Case)

This program makes a C-language fragment that is an array of unsigned
characters that constitutes a translation table used to fold characters
down to their base case (or character).

This is especially necessary for folding Latin-1 characters down to the
representative regular ASCII capital character.
