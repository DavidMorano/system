GROPE-DICT


= David Morano, years ago
  This program was originally made because I noticed that there was
  no convenient way to rebuild the 'grope' dictionary database.

  It's funny how a program can go for so many years and never show
  the signs of a subtle bug.  This program was rebuilding the dictionary
  incorrectly !  We were putting words that start with a capital letter
  into their own dictionary files when what we should have done was to
  merge words that start with the same letter (upper or lowercase)
  into the SAME dictionary file.  I guess that we (mankind) may never
  know the extent of the bugs that we put into our programs.

I modified the program in order to not have to delete or truncate the
existing dictionary files before creating the entire dictionary database.
Previously, the program required that all of the dictionary files be
deleted or truncated to zero before being rebuilt.  The old behavior
was error prone.  It took until now to botg notice this and to correct it.
