MAINTQOTD

This directory contains the backstore for Quotes-of-the-Day (in file
form).  Each quote is stored in a file named by the Modified-Julian-Day
(MJD) of the day of the quote with a 'q' character prefixed.  Theses
files are in turn stored in subdirectories named by the MJD divided
by 100 with a prefix of 'd'.  This arrangement is established so that
no single directory will contain more than 100 files.  This keeps
searching directories by the system to remain fast.

Enjoy!
