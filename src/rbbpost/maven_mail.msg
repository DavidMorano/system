Hi David,

I'm with The Maven Group and we've contacted you in the past about
software openings. Hope you've been well. We call it Career Karma
-hoping you might help out a sharp computer science grad you may know
(your kids, friends' kids, people you know from school, etc) to get a
career foothold with a great organization.  And if we place someone you
send to us, The Maven Group will pay you a finders fee, so it's a
win-win.   

 

We've filled 1 but we have 2 more Junior Software Engineer openings with
an east coast high-tech design center client - they make mechatronics
systems.  These are direct hire openings for computer science or
computer engineering grads who graduated in the last 1-5 years and have
a good base of object oriented development knowledge (whether C#, Java
or C++).  They will start out doing C++ object oriented development but
will work into firmware/embedded design. The client has a strong team of
senior level folks and they are looking for a few junior developers to
come in and grow with this rapidly growing global high-tech design
organization. These roles would require relocation (excellent relocation
package included to the beautiful New England coast).  

 

Of course we have various other levels and types of software (Java and
C++, for algorithm optimization, compilers, graphics/simulations and/or
analytics in Boston, Michigan, NC, DC) and engineering openings. I
wanted to keep this short but I'm happy to send you more info.  If you
know any Junior software engineers, please pass my info to them
urgently. Appreciate your help to get the word out.

 

 
 

Thank you,

Nanci Cronk
