RBBPOST


= version 1a

Dave Morano, 97/05/02

1) This was a complete rewrite of the older 'rbbpost' program.
   Compiled OK.


= version 1b

Dave Morano, 97/xx/xx/

1) Some sort of minor update.


= version 1c

Dave Morano, 99/02/02

1) Articles that have bad (non-existent) newsgroups now get "posted"
   (if you want to call it that) to a special directory to collect
   all of the "dead" articles.

2) I fixed a bad catastrophic bug in the 'broadcast' code.
   The bug should have been caught by compile-time subroutine
   argument checking but that was not operating because
   the include file containing the subroutine templates
   was not being included !

3) The program invocation argumment key was changed for specifying
   article-IDs.  It is now done with : '-ID article-id'.
