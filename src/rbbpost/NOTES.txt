RBBPOST

This is the PCS program to post articles to the PCS newsgroups.  This
is the raw interface to the newsgroup system.  The BBPOST program (and
possibly other programs) call this program to do the actual work of
posting the article in the newsgroup area and updating any databases
that may need to be updated.

SYNOPSYS:

$ rbbpost [<newsgroup(s)> ...] [-f <from>] [-s <subject>]
	[-ROOT <programroot>] [-q] [-N <dir>] [-V]

ARGUMENTS:

-f <from>	sending user's mail address (generic)
-s <subject>	subject to be placed in article header
<newsgroup(s)>	the newsgroups that the article is to be spooled on
-q		be quiet about errors or newsgroups not found
-MAILER <prog>	mailer used to compose message (the calling program)
-ROOT		program root directory
-N <dir>	the directory where the news articles will be spooled
-V		print program version to standard-error and then exit

ALL CASES:

The article content to be spooled is on standard input.

PROGRAM SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION FILES:

${PCS}/etc/bb/bbhosts	hosts that we are supposed to send out to

The BB spool forward file format:

	RBBPOST_F <len> <cksum> <version>
	forward-to-host
	article-id				(file within any newsgroup)
	newgroup1
	newgroup2
	...

This file format is what is spooled when an article needs to be
forwarded.  The file is spooled in a subdirectory after the name of the
'forward-to-host' name.  The 'len' and the 'cksum' (if present) cover
the file starting after the first line.

The BB network forwarding transfer format:

	RBBPOST_F <len> <cksum> <version>
	forward-to-host
	article-id				(file within any newsgroup)
	newgroup1
	newgroup2
	...
	EOH					(just a blank line)
	article_file_content			(just the whole file)

This file format is constructed when a file is being transmitted
between hosts.  The header portion of the file contains extra
information about the article to be transmitted.  The 'len' and 'cksum'
cover the article file content only.  The header portion is NOT
protected!
