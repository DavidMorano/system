# CONF (PCS)
# PCS site configuration file

#
# This is an administrative configuration file for the Personal Communication
# System (PCS) suite of tools.  The PCS (or system) administrator should add
# entries to this file as appropriate so that the various PCS programs that
# depend on configuration information work properly.  There are really only a
# few possible entries that should be made since most of the configuration
# information is determined automatically by the PCS system itself.
# 
# The most important entry is the "mailhost" entry.  This entry is used to
# properly deliver email in certain circumstances.  This entry is also used in
# part to determine the return address for outgoing email messages.  This entry
# is used in programs for both email (as expected) but also for bulletin board
# postings and message postings (using the "msgs" program).  Also some job
# transfer programs like "rslow" use this entry.  This entry is not needed if
# you have an alias name of "mailhost" in your "hosts" IP address database.
# 
# The next most important entry is the "uucphost" entry.  This entry is used to
# properly deliver email, bulletin board postings, messages, and internally
# transferred jobs (using "rslow") via the UUCP system.  If your system does
# not have UUCP, then you can ignore this entry and leave it undefined.  If you
# have UUCP (the system determines this automatically), then in the absence of
# the "uucphost" entry, the "mailhost" parameter described above will be used
# (assumed) to be your site's local UUCP host.  This entry is not needed if you
# have an alias name of "uucphost" in your "hosts" IP address database.
# 
# The "userhost" entry is only important if you (or the site system
# administrators) do NOT allow user programs to run on the "mailhost" or
# "uucphost" machines.  If this is the case, you should define this entry to be
# the host where your PCS daemon programs are running.  It is assumed that the
# PCS system is treated like user programs.  It is pretty important that this
# host have access to both the email system (at least as a normal user) and the
# UUCP system (as a normal user).  If the "userhost" does not have proper
# access to either the mail system or the UUCP system, then strange things
# might happen.  Most PCS programs try to make up for poorly configured sites
# by scanning the local DNS domain for hosts and their capabilities but this is
# limited, sometimes flawed and not always optimum.
# 
# Moreover, you should define the "relay" and "gateway" entries to be what the
# company's current mail relay and mail gateway machines are.  For example,
# both the relay and gateway machines within AT&T used to be the machine 'att'
# or 'attbl'.  In Lucent Technologies, the machine was 'emsr' or
# 'emsr.lucent.com'.  This is what we are talking about here.  This is
# obviously used to send email to otherwise unreachable machines within the
# company and to send email outside of the company.  These entries should have
# full domain names attached if this is important to properly resolving and
# reaching the machine.
# 
# You can enter an "organization" entry if the name of the company changes
# abruptly.  As of 1996, it is assumed that the name of the company or
# organization (by default) is "Lucent Technologies".
# 
# If your local PCS Postmaster person is not at email address "pcs", then you
# should enter a "postmaster" entry with the proper email address of your PCS
# administrator.
# 
# Finally, the 'pcsconf' program can be executed to test proper determination
# of the underlying information which may be partly derived from the entries in
# this file.  Note carefully, that the results of the 'pcsconf' program, in
# general, do NOT match exactly the entries with the same or similar names
# specified in this file.  Differences between entries in this file and the
# output of the 'pcsconf' program (which reflects actual internal PCS system
# usage) are due to the fact that the PCS system further processes information
# in this file in light of the current dynamically determined execution
# environment.  Dynamic interactions during program execution are far too
# numerous to elaborate here or possibly anywhere (if ever even known).
# 
#
# Entries in this file take the form:
#	keyword		[optional_arguments]
#
#
# Strings other than keys, or variable names that are being set, are expanded
# by substituting on certain escape sequences.  These escape sequences are
# single letters preceeded by a percent ('%') sign character.  The following
# escapes are recognized:
# 
#	R		PCS program root
#	N		machine node name
#	D		machine domain name
#	H		machine host name
#
#
# Possible entries include:
#
#	keyword		description
#------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#	pcsusername	this should be the login user name of the
#			PCS login (usually also the administrator login)
#
#	mailhost	This should be the organization's local
#			mail cluster mail host machine.  This is
#			usually the machine that has the mail spool
#			area on it.  
#			This entry is not needed if
#			you have an alias name of "mailhost" in
#			your "hosts" IP address database.
#
#	uucphost	This is the local site's UUCP host.  If you do
#			not have UUCP anywhere in your site, you can
#			leave this variable undefined.
#			This entry is not needed if
#			you have an alias name of "uucphost" in
#			your "hosts" IP address database.
#
#	userhost	This should be the name of a host that a user
#			can log into or one that a user program (like
#			PCS daemon programs) can run on.  Unfortunately,
#			this alternate host is sometimes necessary because
#			of the practice of many sites to NOT allow users,
#			including the PCS daemon programs, to run on
#			the "mailhost" machine or the "uucphost" machine.
#			Becasue this host usually runs the PCS daemon
#			programs it MUST have access to both the mail
#			spool area AND the UUCP spool area.  It goes
#			without saying that this host must also have
#			full access to the outbound UUCP system (if
#			there is one) in order to properly send out
#			email.
#
#	fromhost	This variable will give the name of the machine
#			that should form the return address for outgoing
#			email.  If this variable is not defined, then it
#			is assumed that the 'mailhost' above (or whatever
#			it turns out to be in the PCS system) will be used
#			as the return address in outgoing email.
#
#	relay		This should be the corporate relay host
#			for routing of all internal email which
#			cannot be done directly from this local
#			site.  
#			If this is not set, it will default to 
#			whatever the "gateway" is set to if it is set.
#			This entry should have a full domain name
#			attached if this is important to properly
#			resolving and reaching the machine.
#
#	gateway		This should be set to the corporate machine
#			which routes all email to outside of
#			the company.
#			If this is not set, it will default to 
#			whatever the "relay" is set to if it is set.
#			This entry should have a full domain name
#			attached if this is important to properly
#			resolving and reaching the machine.
#
#	postmaster	This should be set to the email address of the
#			local PCS postmaster.
#
#	version		If you want to change the version string
#			returned by program PCSV or 'pcsconf version'.
#			Do not change this just for fun since it
#			may confuse users about what vesion of the
#			PCS distribution is installed.
#
#
# Variables can also be set using the "set" keyword.  Variable names often take
# on the form "module:name" to direct the variable to a specific component of
# the PCS system.  Free variables, variables without module qualifiers, are
# also allowed.
# 
#
# Finally, unrecognized keys are saved for perusal by programs that may want to
# examine them.  They have completely free format value fields that must be
# parsed by all interested programs.
# 
#
# Example entries are:
#
#	mailhost		mtgbcs
#	uucphost		mtgbcs
#	userhost		mthost2

#	relay			emsr.lucent.com
#	gateway			emsr.lucent.com
#	orgdomain		lucent.com
#	postmaster		pcs
#	organization		"Lucent Technologies"
