> Approaching
>
> The ACM Gordon Bell Prize has been awarded since 1987 to recognize =20
> outstanding achievement in high-performance
> computing. It is now administered by the Association for Computing =20
> Machinery (ACM), with financial support provided
> by Gordon Bell, a pioneer in high-performance and parallel computing.
>
> The purpose of the award is to track the progress of leading-edge =20
> technical computing, namely simulation, modeling
> and large-scale data analysis as applied to science, engineering or =20=

> other fields. Recent winners have been awarded
> for landmark computations at performance rates that have in some =20
> cases topped 100 teraflop per second. In addition
> to the main ACM Gordon Bell Prize, the Bell Prize Committee may, at =20=

> its discretion, grant a special award to recognize
> an achievement in a related area such as price/performance, usage =20
> of innovative techniques or non-traditional types
> of computation.
>
> To be considered for the ACM Gordon Bell Prize a paper must be =20
> submitted describing achievements in this arena to
> the SC08 Conference, via the conference website on the ACM Gordon =20
> Bell Prize track (which is separate track from
> regular technical papers). Background information and additional =20
> details on submission guidelines can be found at:

> by submitting proposals for tutorials at SC08. The SC08 Tutorials =20
> program will give attendees the
> opportunity to explore a wide variety of important topics related =20

> networking, and storage. SC08 invites proposals for introductory, =20
> intermediate, and advanced
> tutorials, either full-day (six hours) or half-day (three hours). A =20=

> distinguished panel of experts
> will select the tutorials from the submitted proposals. The =20
> deadline for submitting proposals for
> tutorials, panels and workshops has been extended to Monday, April =20
> 14, 2008.
>
> At the SC07 conference in Reno, nearly 1,000 attendees registered =20

> SC08 Hotels - New Process to begin soon!
>
> SC08 has contracted for more than 4,100 hotel rooms in the Austin =20
> area for Exhibitors and
> Technical Program attendees this year. The conference has =20
> instituted a new allocation process that
> intends to be more fair and equitable to all attendees.
>
> Exhibitor Housing opened April 1, 2008. The current contracted =20
> Exhibitor Booth Bosses will be
> notified by email of the new process. (Please note that Exhibitors =20
> have been apportioned approximately
> 1,500 hotel rooms that are in the downtown area as well as =20
> additional hotel rooms outside of the downtown
> area.) Exhibitor Booth Bosses must consolidate their exhibitor =20
> lists to coincide with the new process -
> only one housing request per Exhibitor Booth will be accepted. The =20
> selection process and the number
> and location of rooms allocated to a request will be based on the =20
> requesting Exhibitor's priority points,
> the size, i.e., square footage of its SC08 exhibit space, and its =20
> SC07 housing history. At the same time
> that an Exhibitor submits a housing request, it also can request =20
> Hotel meeting space.
>
> Technical Program Attendee Housing will open August 4, 2008. At =20
> this time a block of 1,565 hotel
> rooms in the downtown area as well as rooms in hotels outside of =20
> the downtown area will be made
> available to Technical Program Attendees. SC08 and the Austin =20
> Convention and Visitors Bureau's
> Housing Service will use a Web-based housing management and =20

> The hotels that are outside of the downtown area are close to the =20

> launched this year.
> SC Your Way will consist of two portals: SC - Your Way (for =20

> SC08 Exhibits Co-Chair.
>
> "We are excited by the response of exhibitors to Austin, they =20
