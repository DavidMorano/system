Subject: Conservative Update 99/08/30 -- presidential update
Date: Mon, 30 Aug 1999 18:48:11 -0400 (EDT)
.DE

Dear Conservative Update readers,

I am not happy about the fact that there has been much in noteworthy
news lately.  I know that you all are busy and have plenty of other
matters (like myself) to attend to rather than reading my email
updates.  Unfortunately, there have been some political events lately
(and other matters) that you should be aware of.

I have kept this update short but I have included some older material
on Clinton and his Chinese buddies in case you have not followed that
story closely.  It is no real surprise to anyone now that Bill Clinton
has committed high treason against the United Status of America but
these things often take a long time to work themselves out through
history when the corrupting power is currently the President of the
United States of America !

Topics covered today are :

+ Political parties in the United States

+ Presidential update

+ Bush on the Constitution and the Second Amendment

+ Forbes is, and has been, bad from day one !

+ Clinton on creationism being taught in schools

+ Senator Inhofe's China statement in the Senate

+ Gertz on China (and Clinton)

+ Noteworthy quotes for your collection

+ Pictures of Clinton and your favorite GOP candidates



Political Parties in the United States
===============================================================================

We all know that the Democratic Party and the Grand Old Party (GOP) are
the two largest political parties in the United States now-a-days.  But
who do you think is the third largest political party in the United
States ?  Do you think that it is the Libertarian Party ?  The
Libertarian Party played a big role (maybe its biggest ever
percentage-wise) in the 1990 presidential election.  What were the
other parties on the scene back in 1980 ?  The Nazis or the Communist
Party ?  It was probably the Libertarian Party by far that was the next
biggest to the top two parties.  Oh, if you don't already know, the
Democrat "Slime Ball" Party is by far the largest with the GOP making
up a distant second.  Sometimes we think that the GOP is huge but this
is more to do with the fact that the party is so politically broad
rather than the fact that they have the numbers !

Well, who is the third largest party today ?  Is it still the
Libertarians or someone new ?  Well you might think that it is the
other slime ball group called the Reform Party (Ross Perot's party) but
think again.  I won't keep you in suspense any longer.  The third largest
political party in the United States today is the U.S.Taxpayer's
party !  Ya, I couldn't believe it myself when I first heard it.
The order is :

.DS I
	Democrat
	GOP
	U.S.Taxpayer's
	Reform
	Libertarian
	<everybody else>
.DE

The liberal media in the United States just doesn't like covering the
U.S.Taxpayer's party (and the party should try and do something about
that if I were them) because the media is too afraid of them.  Read the
draft convention platform (included as an attachment) and you can try
and figure out why yourself.

Presidential update
===============================================================================
.DE

First some updates if you have not been following the political scene
for a while.  The GOP Iowa straw poll (this was a GOP only event) held
this past August 14 is over.  It was hyped up to be some sort of
blessing for the winner and a possible political curse for the rest.
If you do not already know, Bush came in first by a reasonable margin.
The results are as follows :

.DS
who		votes	percentage
----------------------------------
Bush		7418	31
Forbes		4921	21
Dole		3410	14
Bauer		2114	9
Buchanan	1719	7
Alexander	1428	6
Keyes		1101	5
Quayle		916	4
Hatch		558	2
McCain		83	0
Kasich		9	0
Smith		8	0	(Smith dropped out of GOP before the poll)
.DE

Contrary to what the Bush spin machine has been saying, Bush did not
break "all records" for this poll.  His own father got 36% of the vote
previously in this poll.  What the pundits are saying is that Forbes is
shaping up to be the only real threat to Bush in the coming
primary/caucus battle.

In other news, Bob Smith has stated that he will not be seeking the
nomination of the U.S.Taxpayer's party.  Apparently, he has some
problem with joining them and he further does not want it to appear
that he is getting "married so soon after getting divorced" (his
characterization of the matter not mine).  Maybe this is a little
indicator that Smith was not the man for us after all !  This is just
speculation on my part.  Details of why Smith objects to joining the
party are still lean and there seems to be another story, not yet
revealed, that may explain Smith's recent decision.

With regard to the U.S.Taxpayer's party, they are holding their
Presidential Nominating Convention this September in St. Louis Missouri
(home of the Presbyterian Church in America seminary "Covenant").  The
event continues from the 1st to the 6th of September.  Some of the
highlights of the convention are :

.DE


There is a remote chance that Pat Buchanan might turn to the
U.S.Taxpayer's party for their nomination but it is sure getting late
now if that is what he ever wanted to do.  The truth is that the party
would give it to him if he wanted it.  As late as last week though,
there had been statements from the U.S.Taxpayer's party that if
Buchanan wanted their nomination, that Buchanan had to seek it.  He
will not be asked to consider the nomination as he apparently was in
the past.  My feeling, and the feeling of others, is that deep down
Buchanan does not want to do anything to split the GOP vote or
otherwise hurt the GOP in any way.  Please go and check out the
U.S.Taxpayers Party web site at :

.DS I
	http://www.ustaxpayers.org/
.DE

for excellent information on the party, their entire draft platform
and specific articles on other matters.

So there we have the current presidential breakdown.  Let's be honest
for a moment and talk about what is really going to happen as this
presidential election cycle plays out :

.BL 8
.LI
Al (robot) Gore will get the Democratic Party nomination
.LI
G.W. Bush will get the GOP nomination
.LI
somebody will get get the U.S.Taxpayer's nomination (this could possibly
be Howard Phillips but it could be somebody else also)
.LI
somebody (probably Perot) will get the reform party nomination
.LI
somebody (maybe Harry Browne again) will get the Libertarian Party
nomination
.LE


.DS
Q. What should we conservatives do in light of these facts ?

A. Start supporting U.S.Taxpayer's Party candidate as soon as possible !
.DE


Do you remember the 1996 presidential election cycle ?  Sure, you did
not want Clinton in for another four years so you choked on your own
tongue, held your nose, and voted for Dole !  (Oh you did know that
Dole was dirty by cheating on his first wife with a little slut, didn't
you ?  Dole made a special deal with Clinton during the 1996 campaign.
The deal was that Dole wouldn't bring up Clinton's ... well ...
indiscretions if Clinton would not bring up Dole's little problem.)
Well I hope that we have learned our lessons from that fiasco.  Some
of us recognized the foolishness of voting for Dole back in 1996 but we
all learn at our own pace.  Well I trust that you have learned
something over these past four years about playing the game as a sucker
just as they (the major parties) wanted you to.  Do I have to remind
you about all the outrageous things that has happened in these past four
years ?

We do not want to support another dirty candidate (Bush) like we did
back in 1996 with Dole.  Do yourself and your conscience a favor this
time around.  Vote for the U.S.Taxpayer's party candidate !

.DS
+ Bush on the Constitution and the Second Amendment
===============================================================================

anti-constitutional political position.  This particular article
reports on Bush's call for more draconian/totalitarian gun restriction
measures.  The article is by James Pilcher from UPI.


.DS
Forbes is and has been bad from day one !
===============================================================================
.DE

I assume that you all already know that G.W. Bush is bad.  If you do
not already know this, then please email me and tell me to take you off
of my "update" mailing list.  I will say good bye to you and quietly
not bother you again.  Actually, I assume that you all also know that
Forbes is bad.  The problem is that many conservatives want to believe
in things.  They want to believe that the GOP is still the good party
to be in.  They wanted to believe that Gingrich was a nice guy.  They
want to believe that Trent Lott is still an OK guy even if he makes a
few bad, very bad, decisions now and again.  Lott still cries to Bob
Dornan now and again that he (Lott) is an "OK" guy.  (As an aside,
Trent Lott was one of the conservatives that Paul Weyrich and Jerry
Falwell worked to get into office with their Moral Majority movement.)
This is one of the biggest problems with conservatives now-a-days, we
want to believe in the best about people.  Well the media helps us
along in believing in the best about people.  (Didn't you know that
this is one of the main jobs of the press !)  Well Forbes seems to be
courting conservatives again with his "I'm a pro-lifer" message.  This
is especially important to him as the GOP nomination race narrows
down.  Forbes must make most, if not all, pro-lifers think that he is
on their side.  I thought that I would share with you some information
about Forbes' so called "pro-life" position.

In 1996, the National Right to Life political action committee
investigated Forbes' claims on the abortion issue and concluded that he
was faking it and that he was really just another pro-death candidate.
They wanted to get the word out on Forbes so badly that they spent
their hard earned money the very week of the 1996 campaign primary in
New Hampshire to take out full page newspaper advertisements denouncing
Forbes' claim.  In 1996 Forbes declined to return the questionnaire on
the abortion question from the Republican National Coalition for Life.
Forbes also refused to sign a pledge that he would uphold the
Republican pro-life plank from the 1996 GOP convention (remember that
the GOP convention platform actually was pretty conservative back in
1996 -- Dole just refused to acknowledge it !).  Asked (95/09/24) about
whether Forbes would be in favor of overturning Roe vs. Wade, Forbes
evaded the question with "The only [way] you're going to get a change
in court opinions is if there's a fundamental change in public
opinion."  Maybe true enough but it also reveals which way Forbes'
weather vane points, with the liberals !  Asked if he would sign the
Christian Coalition pledge to support a constitutional amendment
supporting life (and overturning Roe), Forbes replied "I'm not going to
sign any of those pledges."

Through most of 1998, Forbes has been playing up to the pro-lifers
because he knows that he cannot keep the whole of the GOP right-wingers
in line with him to final victory unless he is seen to be a pro-lifer.
Unfortunately, he revealed his true position on the issue when asked on
June 10 of 1998 about possible vice-presidential running mates,
Forbes replied "If I run and get the nomination, he [speaking of
New York's governor Pataki] would certainly be on my short list."
I'm sure that you all know that Pataki is a flaming pro-death advocate.

You may be aware that recently Paul Weyrich (co-founder with The
Reverend Jerry Falwell of the 1970s movement to get Christians into
public office -- the Moral Majority movement) endorsed Forbes for the
GOP nomination and for president.  Don't be fooled that Weyrich is
endorsing Forbes.  Weyrich is a pragmatist who is fed up with simply
loosing elections.  If he really cared, he would not have called on
Christians earlier this year to simply drop out of the political scene ! 
I do not want to be too hard on Weyrich but Forbes is nowhere near an
ideal conservative candidate even by Weyrich's own account when he made
his endorsement of Forbes public.

Would I vote for Forbes over Bush if they were the only two possible
candidates (in some sort of fantasy end-of-the-world nightmare
scenario) ?  Sure, I suppose that I would.  But why play fantasy games
when we can vote for the U.S.Taxpayers Party candidate ?  Give your
conscience a break for a change and vote Right !

"How has it happened, sir, that we have not hitherto once thought of
humbly applying to the Father of lights to illuminate our understanding ?  
In the beginning of the contest with Britain, when we were sensible
of danger, we had daily prayers in this room for divine protection.  Our
prayers, sir, were heard, and they were graciously answered.  All of us
who were engaged in the struggle must have observed frequent instances
of a superintending Providence in our favor. ... And have we now
forgotten this powerful friend ?  Or do we imagine we no longer need His
assistance ?"

Bush Backs Some Gun-Control Efforts 
by James Pilcher
Friday August 27, 1999; 1:36 p.m. EDT
Associated Press 
.DE


MARIETTA, Ga. -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush, bringing his GOP
presidential campaign to an area stung by episodes of wanton gun
violence, today endorsed efforts in Congress to raise the legal age for
gun ownership to 21 from 18.

Bush also backed proposals in Congress to outlaw certain large
ammunition clips and repeated his support for background checks on
firearms sales at gun shows.

\&``I support them all,'' Bush said when asked about the proposals.
\&``These are all reasonable measures.''

Democrats have attacked Bush as being soft on gun control, noting he
has spoken against government-mandated gun registration, signed
legislation barring cities in Texas from suing gun makers for the costs
of violence, and deemed mandatory child safety locks on firearms
impractical to enforce.

Bush today stressed his core belief in gun rights. ``I believe innocent
people, law-abiding citizens, ought to be allowed to own a gun,'' he
told reporters. ``I believe they ought to be allowed to hunt and
protect themselves.''

He said previously he would have voted for legislation defeated by the
House that would have required a 24-hour background check on weapons
sales at gun shows. Most Democrats pushed for a longer waiting period
and argued a 24-hour mandate actually would have allowed some gun show
sales to move faster.

Bush was ending a three-day Southern campaign swing in the Atlanta
area, where several shootings this summer commanded national
attention.

On July 29, Mark O. Barton shot and killed nine people at two
day-trading firms in Atlanta before committing suicide. Barely two
weeks earlier, a gunman killed two women and four children in their
Atlanta home before killing himself. In May, a 15-year-old boy opened
fire at his high school in suburban Conyers, wounding six classmates.

Bush started the day touring a church-run homeless shelter. He held it
out as an example of a religious organization that should be eligible
for government money.

How Beijing hopes to defeat the West --
Author reveals threatening nuclear strategy

By Jon E. Dougherty
WEDNESDAY JUNE 09, 1999
WorldNetDaily.com
.DE

Unlike the former Soviet Union, China is not interested in matching
America "warhead for warhead," according to a noted defense
correspondent and author of a best-selling new book on Chinese
espionage.

Bill Gertz, a defense reporter for The Washington Times and author of
the new book, "Betrayal: How the Clinton Administration Undermined
American Security," said that not only does China pose a national
security threat to the United States, but that Beijing is building up
military forces for other than regional security interests.

"The Chinese are engaged in a pretty serious strategic and conventional
military buildup," Gertz told WorldNetDaily. "The alarming part of that
is that it doesn't appear as though they're building up forces just for
a regional conflict. It appears as though they're developing forces
[strictly] to oppose the United States."

Gertz said the People's Liberation Army "is building nuclear missiles
and new types of warheads," based in large measure on technology robbed
from U.S. weapons labs.  "Throughout the '90s, that gleaning of
technology was also based on technology transfers" with the cooperation
and approval of the Clinton administration.

Gertz said China "still has only a modest nuclear force," but that
Beijing's "strategy is not the same as the U.S. and Russia, which tried
to match each other warhead for warhead." Instead, he said, China is
engaged in "asymmetric warfare, where they're developing a few
high-tech weapons able to counter a better-armed foe." That, however,
includes about 20 long-range nuclear missiles -- 13 of which are aimed
at America, according to Gertz's sources and the CIA.

These long-range weapons "each have huge warheads," he said, "in the
neighborhood of about five megatons each." He said intelligence and
weapons specialists called them "city busters," because the amount of
destruction they could do is enormous.

Beyond that, he added, "based on the U.S.  technology they've attained
from us," the Chinese are in the process of building two road-mobile
missiles that will have the capacity to deliver weapons "within three
years." He said these weapons "are expected to have multiple warheads."
Gertz said that was important "because the U.S. is planning -- we
haven't done it yet -- but we're planning to have missile defenses, and
those multiple warheads would be aimed at defeating any [U.S.]
defenses."

"The U.S. decided not to build mobile missiles," he said, "but our
country does have submarine-launched nuclear missiles, which are the
backbone of our nuclear triad." That triad, he said, consists of land,
air and sea launched weapons.

"In today's world, I think you do need a mix of weapons systems, but
mobile missile systems are definitely the weapon of the future," he
said. The defense correspondent added that in the Gulf War, the single
largest producer of casualties "were Iraq's SCUD missiles, which were
carried around on trucks" and hence difficult to locate and destroy.

"Theoretically, you could put a nuclear-tipped ballistic missile like
that on the deck of a freighter, park a couple hundred miles off the
U.S. coast, and launch one of them at an American city," he said. "In
my book I make the point that that's the real reason you need to have
missile defenses, and this administration has steadfastly refused to"
build them.

The author also said the negotiated agreements between Russia and China
are endangering national security. Gertz said during the Cold War, the
U.S. had set up electronic listening posts in China to monitor Soviet
military and political activities. "Playing the China card," as it was
called then, was based on a mutual cooperation with Beijing that simply
does not exist today.

"Today, China is 'playing the Russia card' against the U.S.," he said,
"and that's an alliance that is definitely aimed against the United
States. The Chinese seem to be prodding the Russians away from the
West." He added that Beijing and Moscow are cooperating by trading
weapons and economic incentives, and it has led to new border
agreements between the two countries as well. That, he said, has
allowed China to move large numbers of troops from its western border
with Russia "to be used for internal security duty."

Gertz said espionage has been directed at the U.S. "for a number of
decades, and we didn't really learn about it until 1995." But very
little was done to try and stop it, he said, "which seems more than
just benign neglect" on the part of the Clinton White House.

"You have to look at this in the context of large amounts of Chinese
government cash that was going into Democrat Party coffers around
1996," he said, "so it appears on the surface as though the Clinton
administration either slowed down their interdiction efforts or simply
looked the other way."

He said China has already tested the most modern nuclear warhead
modeled on the W-88, the United States' most up-to-date design "a
number of times."

"This is the most advanced warhead" in the world, Gertz told
WorldNetDaily, adding that the W-88 was currently deployed "on
Trident-II missiles, which are on U.S.  submarines." He said the
warhead is a small device that can be used in multiple configurations
and can be adapted to "short range missiles, which China is deploying
against Taiwan."
