PCSCONF

This is part of the Personal Communications System (PCS) package.  This
is a program which calls the PCS configuration interface to get the
dynamic PCS configuration for the calling user program.

Optional items that can be displayed with this program are:

	mailhost        mailnode        maildomain      orgdomain       
	logname         username        version         relay           
	gateway         postmaster      organization    fromhost        
	fromnode        gecosname       mailname        name            
	fullname        uucphost        uucpnode        userhost        
	nodename        hostname        domainname      nisdomain       
        peername


Notes on domains:

There are too many of them!! :-)

No seriously, there are!! :-) :-)

The various "domain"s are not always clearly used or understood.
Here are some suggestions:

which		example
----------------------------------------

domain		ho.att.com
nisdomain	nis.ho.att.com
orgdomain	att.com
maildomain	mt.att.com (or 'att.com' depending on local EMA part)


The "from" address is usually created as:

	username@mailhost
	dam@mtgbcs.att.com

or

	username@maildomain
	dam@mt.att.com

an alternative might be:

	mailname@orgdomain
	d.a.morano@att.com
