HOLS

This program prints the holidays for today and possibly future days.

What exactly this program adds to HOLIDAY (command) is not really clear!

	$ hols
appears to essentially be:
	$ holiday
and:
	$ hols 21
(as an example) is essentially:
	$ holiday +21
so I don't get it (why does this program really exist)!
