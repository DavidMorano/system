FILTER-A (needs update fixing!)

This program reads a file with email addresses appearing on lines, possibly more
than one on a line but comma separated. All email addresses found are isolated
and then written one per line to the output file.

For more comprehensive extraction of mail addresses from mail messages, see the
'ema(1)' program.
