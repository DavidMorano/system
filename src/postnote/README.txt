POSTNOTE

This program is similar to the 'rbbpost' program but instead posts a note to a
newsgroup that is really a MSGS spool directory. This program allows MSGS spool
directories to be treated almost like BBNEWS newsgroup directories. The MSGS
program is actually used to post the note.

Synopsis:
$ postnote newsgroup < input.msg

Example:
$ postnote msgs.rc < test.msg
