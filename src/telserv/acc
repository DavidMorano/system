# ACCTAB

#
# Each entry usually starts with a 'netgroup' name and then a listing
# of the machine/user/password tripples that make up that netgroup.
#
# If no netgroup name is given, then the following tripples belong to the
# default netgroup.  The default netgroup may be used (depending on which
# listening server you are interested in: rexecd, rxsd, et cetera) for
# services that did not specify any netgroup names in their service
# table entry and if the listening server was configured to use access
# restrictions for incoming connections.
# 
# Finally, note that many servers use the SunOS NIS (Yellow Pages) or
# Solaris NIS+ 'netgroup' database in addition to this database for
# authorizing remote access.  Note that neither NIS or NIS+ allows
# for passwords so only this database can be used if password protection
# is needed.
# 
# Format of entries:
#
# netgroup:
#	machine			[user			[password]]
#
#

# EXAMPLES:
#
#
# mygroup:
#	mymachine.com		myself			notlikely
