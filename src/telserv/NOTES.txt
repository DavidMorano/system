TELSERV

This program is a Telnet server program.  It is hacked from the Sun
Microsystems version (which has the 'telmod' hack in it).  This one is
used to get a freebee login (no login or password sequence) to the user
'guest'.  This is useful for allowing a special service to run as
user guest in a sandbox type of environment (on the server side).

Is this a security hole?  Probably but life is hard enough already
without looking for trouble where there probably isn't much to be
found.  The security part is how safe the login profile for user guest
is and whether a malicious user can break out of it and get a login
shell prompt!!??

Client-side FD passing is also possible with:

$ telserv -pass[=<fd>] <svc>

An optional service can be passed, overriding any service that
may be acquired from the normal means.
