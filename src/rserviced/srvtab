# Remote Service Listener (RSL) configuration table
#
#	+ sample RSL service table
#
# NOTES:
#
#	All command line arguments have precedence over any corresponding
#	arguments in this configuration file.  The entries in this file
#	do not have any special order.  Defaults are applied in a
#	defined sequence which is independent of the order of defaults
#	in this file.
#

# lines are of the general form :
#
#	key	any_further_arguments
#
# possible keys and their meanings are :
#
#	service		- introduce a service entry
#	control		- controlling lock area directory
#	log		- file path name for the log file
#	export		- environment variable & value to be exported
#	workdir		- working directory
#	wait		- lock file wait time out
#
#
#	There is no order to any entries in this file.  Entries may appear
#	in any order and are still used the same (as for defaults et cetera).
#	The following lines specify system defaults for certain files or
#	directories.  Entries starting with an 'e' are to be exported into
#	the environment.  An unused (or unspecified) field should contain a '-'
#	character.


# the following lines specify defaults for the program

log	rsllog
wait	200			# lock file wait timeout

# additional variables to be exported into the environment

exp	PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/etc:/usr/etc:/usr/add-on/local/bin


# services
#
#	These lines take the form :
#
#		service name command_string
#
#	The following substitutions are made on command strings :
#		%a	original service arguments
#		%s	system name
#		%m	mail address
#		%u	user
#		%w	working directory
#


s	echo	"echo %a %s %f %m %d %l %c %w %r"
s	submit	"submitd %a"
s	prt	"prt %a"
#s	xl	"xld %a"
