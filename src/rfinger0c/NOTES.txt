Sometimes things are simple and sometimes they are not.  Using the
dial-modules capability can be much simpler (or not) depending on the
way you look at it.  If you want to use dial-modules, you need to
proplerly setup the following objects:

DIALER		an object that manages dialers (I think)
SYSTEMS		an object that manages the 'systems' DB
CM		connection manager

The first two objects are arguments to the third.  But once all of
these are setup, you can just use the CM (Connection Manager) object to
make connections to hosts essentially automatically.  The Connection
Manager will lookup the hostname in the 'systems' database (using the
SYSTEMS object) and then will dial out using the DIALER object.
