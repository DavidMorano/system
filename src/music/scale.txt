columns:

A
the mathematical exponent of the note relative to the base frequency of
the first ("1st") note

B
the name of the note for the key of 'C'

C
the note as referenced in a key-independent manner by musicians

D
the frequency of the note in Hz; this is also known to musicians as the
"perfect" frequency; all perfect frequencies are mathematically irrational
multiples of the base frequency (except octave miltiples of the base)

E
the closest ratio for the note using a 7-limit ratio (highest integer
is 7) system; this ratio when multiplied by the frequency of the first
note gives the ratio-metric, rational, or "natural" frequency of the
present note

F
the rational (or "natural") frequency in Hz using the given ratio (col. E)

G
the difference in between the rational ("natural") frequency
and the "perfect" frequency

H
the difference in percent between the rational ("natural") frequency
and the "perfect" frequency as compared with the perfect frequency


Five-limit notes:

Only three notes were available using the 5-limit rational system.
These were the: 1st, 4th, and 5th.


Seven-limit notes:

Only five notes were available using the 7-limit rational system.
These were (as guessed from the table above) the: 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th,
and 6th.


Notes:

Although the frequencies are absolute and correspond to the "concert A"
(A-440 Hz) convention, ratios and percentages are correct for any key
(in addition to the key of 'C' shown).  This is true only because
equitemperament music is ... equitemperament (mathematically
"exponential")!
