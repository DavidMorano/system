POSTFACTS

This program will parse facts from a file and then post each of them
individually to the BBNEWS newsgroups system via the NSGS posting program.

See the file "test.facts" in this directory for an example of the input
format required.

Many details about this program have been lost to history !  From the
dates in the source language files, this program is pretty old indeed
(as compared with "computer time" that is).  Since the program posts
the facts using MSGS, it may be construed that the program has long
outlined its usefulness.  Use it for and whatever it may be still
useful for!
