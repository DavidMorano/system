- "Robbing Peter to Pay Paul"
How did the expression "Robbing Peter to pay Paul" originate? In 1540
the abbey church of St. Peter, Westminster was granted the title of
cathedral but 10 years later it became part of the diocese of London
again. This meant that many of its rich estates had to give revenue
towards the repairs of St. Pauls Cathedral, hence the expression.
