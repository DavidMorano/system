MMCITE

This program is a pre-filter that processes citations found in Memorandum-type
(MM) TROFF documents. It takes source MM-type TROFF source text documents as
input and produces output that has the citations annotated with their
bibliographical data.

Synopsis:
$ mmcite [<file(s)> ...] [-af <argfile>] [-B <incdir(s)>] 
	[-p <bibfile(s)>] [-V]

Arguments:
<file(s)>		files to process
-af <argfile>		list of files to process
-B <incdir(s)>		search directories for unrooted BIB files
-p <bibfiles(s)>	bibliographical files
-V			print program version to standard-error and then exit

Usage in document:

Nope, we're going with the TeX style!  To wit:

.BIB testreferm.rbd
This is a citation \cite{morano99helping} right there!

The REFER database keyletters are as follows:

keyletter	description
-----------------------------------------
Q		citation query key (specified in source citation)
A		author
T		title
J		journal
I		publisher
C		address
V		volume
N		number
P		pages
K		keywords
B		ISBN
D		general-date
YY		year
MM		month
DD		day
R		Library of Congress catalogue number
X		comments
L		label

Implementation strategy:

We read all files and accumulate information about both bibliographical
files and citations within the files.  As a file is processed, we add
any encountered bibliographical files to the BIB DB.  We also store
all citations to the CITE DB.  The addition to a BIB DB is just the
bibliographical file that was specified.  The addition the CITE DB
consists of:

+ the filename where the citation was encountered
+ the file offset where the citation begins
+ the length of the source citation (so that we know where the file resumes)
+ the citation key-string itself

As files are read and processed, intermediate file data (most of the
data from all processed files) is written out to a temporary file.
All offsets are actually referring to locations in the temporary file.
After all files are processed, the temporary file is then processed in
order to substitute into it the expanded citation information that was
originally called for (cited) from the original source citations.
