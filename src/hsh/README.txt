HSH

This is the old home-grown history SHELL that has the command line editing
capabilities like those that were on the SHELLs used on the old PPI-like
computers and others like them. Why do we have better GUIs on home-grown
computer software written from total scratch than we do from more widely used
UNIX systems?
