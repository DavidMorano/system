/*******************************************************************************

	This code converts a c-string of decimal digits into the
	integer type |longlong|.  It is obviously a derivative work
	of the original |strtol(3c)| from the Berkley BSD edition
	of its UNIX® variant.  I am forced to do this since I have
	lost my own conversion-suite version from over forty years
	ago and also lost my other conversion-suite versions (two
	others) from some more recent years ago (all lost to coporate
	America now, which means they are gone). I kind of have to
	laugh at having to make-shift code like this given I had
	coded things like this so long ago and thought that I would
	never have to do it again.
		-- David A.D. Morano, 2023-10-10

	Notes:
	1. This code is limited (by the coding used) to a maximum
	base of 36.
