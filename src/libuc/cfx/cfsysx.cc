	This subroutine was written by being adapted from one of
	my previous versions of the same (from the early 1980s;
	embedded work at AT&T), which itself was adapted from an
	original asembly-language version (in Digital Euipment Corp
	VAX assembly).

	I took the plunge and rewrote this set of subroutine using
	the LIBC subroutines |strtoXX(3c)|, being much simplified
	now.  It is no longer stand-alone, like in the old days,
	but we have been mostly on UNIX®i for some time now (decades)
	and use in non-UNIX®i environments is now quite rare.  I
	hope that this is not a problem.  We will see.

	= 2023-10,10, David A-D- Morano
	I took the liberty to rewite these subroutines in terms of
	a subroutine-template. This did nothing to make the code
	faster in any way. After template expansion the code is the
	same as before.  All type-versions of the former subroutines
	are now in a single subroutine-template. I guess that I had
	too much idle time on my hands.
