SHM (POSIX® Shared Memory)

Shared memory keys (names) have the following structures:


= UID type

	/<uid>¥<id>

where:

<uid>		is the program UID in hexadecimal (8 digits)
¥		is a literal separator character
<id>		is a string identification of at most four (4) characters


= USERNAME type

	/<username>µ<id>

where:

<username>	is the username associated with the program UID (at most 8)
µ		is a literal separator character
<id>		is a string identification of at most four (4) characters


= program-root type

	/<prn>$<id>

where:

<prn>		is the program-root name (up to 8 characters)
$		is a literal separator character
<id>		is a string identification of at most four (4) characters


= Shared-memory segment names tried in turn:

/sys$sm
/<pn>$sm
/<username>¥sm

Steps:

1) try name
2) if not there (SR_NOENT), try to create it
3) if stale (SR_STALE), try to update
4) if cannot update (SR_ACCESS, SR_ISDIR, SR_ROFS), 
	go onto next name and repeat steps 1 through 4
