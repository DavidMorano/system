STRFILTER

This module (really a single obejct) provides a special king of
string filter.  This idea of a "filter" is to see if a string has
already been put into the object or not, but in an especially quick
manner (as quickly as anything can happen now-a-days in this very
complicated world).  There are tons of object (containers) that can
hold strings, but this perticular object should be able to determine
is a string is already present or not faster than most others
(maybe).
