EMA

This directory contains the subroutines to implement the EMA object.
As an aside, the EMA object (stands for 'E-Mail-Address') is used
to hold and manage email addresses.  This object is not extensively
comprehensive in the handling of all email address types or variations,
but it is it (quite) suitable for most email addresses.
