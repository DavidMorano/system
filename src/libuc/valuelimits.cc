        This subroutine was originally written. I provide for both a
        table-lookup type of conversion as well as a computed type of
        conversion.

        I removed the option of compilling a so-called computed type of
        conversion. It is way too complicated when considering the full
        ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) character set (our primary focus). The
        translations-conversions using the table-lookup method (using
        'CHAR(3dam)') are fast and trivially simple. The computed type of
        conversions were not ever chosen. Hence their removal. Why was a
        computed version availble in the first place? I really do not know.
        Someone says that it was used for small embedded applications where
        space was at a super citical premium. Well, just include the
        'CHAR(3dam)' translation tables! They do not really take up a lot of
        space, and available space is not so critically small as it used to be
        (over 30 years ago now)!

/******************************************************************************* 
	These subroutines perform character case conversions (cheaply).  Yes,
	case-conversion is used a lot in embedded systems!

	Implementation note:

        The "CHAR(3dam)' translations (conversions) return an unsigned character
        ('uchar') type. This means that when cajoled into becoming an 'int' type
        on return, it will not be sign-extended.

	= 2014-01-13
        We now use the 'CHAR(3dam)' translation tables only (no computed
        conversion compile-time option). Deal with it. See my note above under
        the revision history. Look how trivial the code is now!
