DAYTIMER


Version History
-----------------------------

1a	= 93/11/07, Dave Morano 

	This version stops displaying after there has been no input to
	the terminal in some amount of time.  It starts displaying time
	again (for a period of time) as soon as some input is typed
	after being idle for a long time.  This feature allows a person
	to see what time it is right now by typing something on the
	terminal that was otherwise idle a long time.


1b	= 98/06/11 Dave Morano 

	This version changes the intput argument keys to :
	-o offset		now for the time offset
	-t timeout		for a screenblanking timeout

	Note that the ability for the user to specify the timeout
	is new.  It was hard coded (#define'ed) before.


1c	= 98/06/15, Dave Morano

	This version only allows one instance of the 'daytimer'
	program to run per terminal.  It uses lock files
	to guarantee this.


1d	= 98/07/10, Dave Morano

	This is the experimental version that cleans up the
	problems with the last version.  There was some sort of
	problem with maintaining the lock file.  I am not sure
	that it is fixed but the lock code now uses the standard
	lock-file object 'lfm' to manage the lock file.


1e	= 98/12/30, Dave Morano

	This version attempts to fix UNIX'es incredibly brain damaged
	signal-interrupt I/O handling philosophy !


1f	= 99/09/22, Dave Morano

	We now look at the MAILPATH variable for a default set of files
	to check for mail changes.
