DAYTIMER

Oh, this program is the little thing that displays the time down there
in the status portion of the terminal screen (or up in the upper right
corner if you do not have a status-line screen).

I do not know how old this program dates to.  I enhanced it in 1993 to
try to detect when there was a hangup of the outer terminal emulation
window that it ran in (in those days).  The GUI stuff had come into its
own for me and I quickly discovered that when 'xterm(1)' windows are
deleted, that they do not always properly send kill signals to the
processes that ran under them.  I do not know whose mistake that was but
it was a hassle with these programs being orphaned because of it.
