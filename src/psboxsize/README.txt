PSBOXSIZE

This little program is a filter. It reads and scans a source language DWB input
file and when it finds a picture inclusion macro (specifically '.BP') it
optionally performs bounding box calculations that substitute for user supplied
dimensions that were not not given (given as '-1' by the user).
