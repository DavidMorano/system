.SH NAME
psboxsize \- filter to calculate missing parameters for DWB picture inclusion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR psboxsize
.\"_
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\"_
.sp
.SS Introduction
.PP
This little program is a filter.  It reads and scans a source language
DWB input file and when it finds a picture inclusion macro
(specifically '.BP') it optionally performs bounding box calculations
that substitute for picture size parameters that were not not
given (given as '-1' by the user).
.\"_
.SS Options
There are no options to this program.
Please the input file on standard input and
you will get the output on standard output.
.\"_
.SS Output
The output will be a copy of the input with the possible
exception that poicture inclusion requests will have missing
information filled in with actual numbers.
If there are no picture inclusion macros, or if there were
picture inclusion macros but no unspecified size parameters
in them, then the output is exactly the same as the input.
.\"_
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
There are no environment variables used by this program.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP \(rh 5
Take a source language DWB file in standard input and
filter it to fill in for missing picture size parameters on
those picture inclusion macros that left some picture size
parameters unspecified:
.EX
\f(CWpsboxsize < file.dwb | troff -Tpost -mpictures > file.troff\fP
.EE

.SH PATH TO
This program is currently located in \fC/usr/add-on/local/bin\fP
or possibly where ever "local" programs are stored on your system.
This is often at
.MW "${LOCAL}/bin"
on some systems.

.SH WARNINGS
Be careful to put at one space between all option key 
letters and the associated
key letter parameter.
