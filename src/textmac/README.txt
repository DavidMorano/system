TEXTMAC (incomplete)

This program changes the old Macintosh line encoding in a file to the UNIX type.

NOTE: This was a failed attempt to write a version of TEXTCLEAN for the Mac, but
only using STDIO. It is still possible (maybe) but all references to many
library calls (not readily available on the Mac) must be either included (code
included with the build) or eliminated.
