MSGSD

This is a little daemon program for the MSGS facility. This really just calls
MSGS with the right options for posting a message.

There is no configuration file for this, just edit the executable and
change the spool directory for the incoming messages !   Make a new
entry for your site names or your site domain (as appropriate) for
setting the correct spool are directory.

Ya, its cheap but its advantage is that ... well, maybe there isn't
an advantage, but its available.
