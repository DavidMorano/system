NOTICED

** This is BADLY not finished.
** This isn't even close to even compiling!



The server listens on (for now) a local UNIX domain socket (DGRAM).

A client sends the notice by queuing it up into a FSMQ (File System
Message Queue).  The server polls the FSMQ for incoming messages.
The client can also give a notice to the server through the server's
UNIX domain socket (DGRAM).  The client can send one of at least two
types of messages:

1) look at FSMQ for incoming notice

2) send the notice that is with this message here


The client sends a message like:

	<service2>
	<tag4>
	<len1>username'\0'
	<len2><text>'\0'

where:

	<text>	this is the notice to write to the terminal

The server sends back:

	<service2>
	<tag4>
	<rc4>
	<len1>termdev'\0'

Service codes are:

0		reserved
1		notice
2		random
