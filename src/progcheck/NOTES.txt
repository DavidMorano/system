PROGCHECK

Dirty! Yes, it (currently) is, but this is extremely useful to sanity-check tons
of files very (very) quickly. This runs very quickly (even though it is coded to
run much slower than it could be) when used in scripts (given it is a built-in
command) or on its own. Someday, if someone is interest, I could clean this
up substantially (given a bit of time to look through this).
