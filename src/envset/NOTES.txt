ENVSET

This little program runs another program with a precise environment.

Symopsis:

$ envset [-df <deffile>] [-xf <envfile>] [-V]
	<progfname> {<arg0>|-} [<argn> ...]]

where:

-df <deffile>	defines
-xf <envfile>	exports
-p <pathfile>	use PATH file for executable search
-V		print program version to standard-error and then exit
<progfname>	program executable to execute
<arg0>		first argument to the program

All options are ON by default for the ENVSET program.

Some standard environment variables are created or retained under normal
circumstances.  Standard environment variables include:

SYSNAME
RELEASE
VERSION
MACHINE
ARCHITECTURE
NODE
DOMAIN
USERNAME
HOME
