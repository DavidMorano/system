.SH DESCRIPTION
.\"_
.SS Introduction
.PP
This program (\fIeas\fP) reads standard input and scans it to find
the various subcircuits that may be contained in it.
The input file is assumed to contain Advice circuit connectivity information
usually organized as circuits or subcircuits.
.\"_
.SS Options
.PP
.IP "-D" 10
This option turns the program debugging more on.
This is normally only used during the development of the
prgram and is not generally useful otherwise.
.IP "-V" 10
This option directs the program to output its version and then
exit.
.IP "-s" 10
This option, or this option in the form \f(CW-s=\fP\fIsuffix\fP,
is used to have all circuits that are extracted written out into
files with the name of the circuit.  Files will always be in lower
case characters even if the circuit names are in uppercase.
If the form of this option is given with the suffix value, the
given suffix will be postpended to the generated file names.
The default file name suffix, if not otherwise specified, is
\fIadv\fP.
.IP "-s=\fIsuffix\fP" 10
See the description for the \(CW-s\fP option alone.
.IP "-t \fItype\fP" 10
This option restricts the types of subcircuits that are extracted
to those that match the specified circuit \fItype\fP.  Allowable
circuit types are :
.EX
envelope
main
subckt
.EE
The envelope circuit is the one that does not have a circuit prototype,
either \f(CWMAIN\fP or \f(CWSUBCKT\fP.  The \fImain\fP and \fIsubckt\fP
types correspond to those circuits in the input file that have the 
prototypes of the given type.  Obviously, Advice libraries generally
only have circuits of the type \fIsubckt\fP.
.\"_
.SS Execution
.P
To extract subcircuits \fIflip2\fP and \fIflip3\fP from the library file
\fIlibrary.adv\fP and put them into
files by the same names, execute :
.EX
eas < library.adv flip2 flip3 -s
.EE
This program will also correctly extract circuits or subcircuits that
are defined in a nested way, like in the Pascal language.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
.IP \(rh 5
To extract subcircuits \fIflip2\fP and \fIflip3\fP from the library file
\fIlibrary.adv\fP and put them into
files by the same names, execute :
.EX
eas < library.adv flip2 flip3 -s
.EE
.IP \(rh 5
To extract all of the subcircuits from the library file
\fIlibrary.adv\fP and put them into
files by the same names, execute :
.EX
eas < library.adv -s
.EE
.IP \(rh 5
To extract subcircuits \fIflip2\fP and \fIflip3\fP from the input file
\fIfile.adv\fP and put them into a common output file named \fIoutput.adv\fP,
execute :
.EX
eas < file.adv flip2 flip3 > output.adv
.EE
.IP \(rh 5
To extract subcircuits \fIflip2\fP and \fIflip3\fP from the library file
\fIlibrary.adv\fP that are only of type \fIsubckt\fP and put them into
files by the same names, execute :
.EX
eas < library.adv flip2 flip3 -s -t subckt
.EE
.IP \(rh 5
To extract just the outer envelope circuit from file \fIinput.adv\fP
and place it in output file \fIoutput.adv\fP,
execute :
.EX
eas < input.adv -t envelope > output.adv
.EE
.IP \(rh 5
To extract just the main circuit from file \fIinput.adv\fP
and place it in output file \fIoutput.adv\fP,
execute :
.EX
eas < input.adv -t main > output.adv

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.PP
The following environment variables
tailor some aspect of the program to the
user's preferences.
.TP 12
.B TMPDIR
This environment variable will direct the program to
create temporary files in the directory specified.  Any specification
of a temporary directory that is given on the command line will
take precedence over this environment variable.
