# book names of the bible
#
# This file contains a list of the names of the books of the Bible.
# The list is ordered in the same order that the books appear in the Bible.
# Book names that have whitespace within their names are further quoted
# with double quotes.  When quoting is needed, the entire book name is
# quoted (this allows for both SHELL-style parsing as well as other
# types).
#
# Each book name should appear on a line by itself.
# Comments and blank lines in this file are ignored.
