SIGDUMP

This program is a signal-dump server.

:-) :-) Your guess is almost as good as mine as to what this thing does (even
though I wrote it myself). I think that it listens for a request from a process
for a notice to dump the signal mask (or something like that) for that process.
It is something along these lines.
