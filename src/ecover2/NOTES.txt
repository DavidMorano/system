ECOVER


Format of encoded file:

+ encoded block of noise
+ encoded first block of data masked by the "mask" block
+ encoded blocks of file concatenated with message 
+ encoded variable-length noise 
+ encoded mask block w/ metadata
+ the key
+ variable trailing noise


This program creates a file envelope (a cover sheet) well suited to
facilitate better encryption of the resultant file.

Synopsis:

$ ecover -e < input > output.ec
$ ecover -d < output.ec > input2
$ cmp input intput2
