OPENPORT

This little program creates a socket and binds it to a reserved (or
any) port.  Arguments to the program are:

+ protocol family
+ protocol type
+ protocol
+ socket_address

It reads the arguments in on STDIN via a message and then passes an
acknowledgement message back on STDIN.  If the acknowledgement is
positive, the message is followed by the file descriptor that was
created.

Synopsis:

$ openport

In practice it is only called by the 'openport(3d)' subroutine.
