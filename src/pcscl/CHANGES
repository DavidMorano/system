Revision history :


= version 0b
  David Morano

1) I added the program invocation option 'f' in order to optionally
   specify a "from_address" when requesting an envelope header be added.

2) The program has been reorganized so that multiple input files
   may be processed with a single invocation of the program.

3) The code to process a program configuration file has been
   added.


= version 0c
  00/03/28, David Morano

1) If envelopes are requested and the existing message has an
   envelope, it is rewritten so that :

	a) it includes a timezone
	b) it has a correct date string
	c) it will have the local timezone (this is a negative)

  Future enhancements should allow for the exiting timezone (if
  given) to be used in the output envelope as well.  This is way
  too complicated to have been done at this time.  This really
  requires a whole new date/time manipulation object to be
  developed that is way beyond the simplicity of the normal
  date/time library subroutines provided by UNIX.  If the source
  code to Solaris ever comes out, maybe we can snarf the date/time
  code and rewrite it into object form so that arbitrary timezones
  can be supported.


= version 0d
  01/12/13, David Morano

1) If a new optional argument is given ('-p'), a RFC-822 style
   "received" postmark is added to the message.
