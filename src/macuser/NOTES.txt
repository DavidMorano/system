MACUSER

Other ways to get various user values:

= real UID
$ id -u -r

= real USERNAME
$ id -u -r -n

= real GUD
$ id -g -r

= real GROUPNAME
$ id -g -r -n

Note that these work off of your current real UID in the process
and not off of what username you logged in as.  So although the
UID might be correst, the USERNAME, GID, and GROUPNAME could all
be incorrect (although still a cousin of the current user, sharing
the same real UID).
