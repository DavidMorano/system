PROCNAMES

This program will read address-book-type entries from a file and then write them
out one line per record to STDOUT. This was REALLY some sort of hack for some
proprietary address-book file format. It reads that original format and writes
the entries in a format with pipe characters between field entries.

Synopsis:
$ procnames < input > output
