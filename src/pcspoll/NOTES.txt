PCSPOLL

This program is called by various PCS services to poll for work that
needs to be done as defined by a service table file.  The service table
file is administered by the PCS administrator to periodically execute
PCS programs (or other programs) that are needed for automatic
operation and maintainence of the PCS system.

There is also an optional configuration file that can set some general
parameters under which the programs in the service table file will be
executed.  The defaults are that all programs executed will be executed
with a user ID of the PCS login on this system.  That is administered
in the general PCSCONF database.  This program ('PCSPOLL') must be
SUID to the PCS login user in order for the default action to occur.

Updated note 1994-02-14:

This is an old program and was not really designed to be too
compute-time efficient.  It gets the job done where it is useful!
It does not cache polling requests but rather re-evaluates them
at each poll interval.  If a prospective request is not needed
during some interval, its request is entirely dropped rather than
caching it until it comes due.  This has not proved to be a problem
at all.
