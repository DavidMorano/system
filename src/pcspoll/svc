# SVC
# PCSPOLL service table
#
#	The format of entries are:
#
#	service:
#		interval= time_period,
#		program= /usr/bin/prog,
#		args=	arg0 arg1,
#		user=	uucp,
#		group=	other,
#		opts=	options
#
#

#
#	The following substitutions are made on keyword value strings:
#
#		%V	PCSPOLL version string
#		%R	PCSPOLL program root
#		%N	nodename
#		%D	domainname
#		%H	hostname

#		%s	service
#		%i	actual interval since last time (decimal secs)

#



# UUCP stuff
#
#	These all are normally run from CRON jobs where the exact
#	times are programmable.  Since we are running them from
#	here we try and arrange that they run rather randomly with
#	respect to each other.  Polling is supposed to happen before
#	scheduling but the world is not perfect !  Also, I suppose
#	that executions would normally occur some time after scheduling
#	has finished carrying out any job file transfers, locally or 
#	remotely.
#
#	Note that the 'pcsuusched' service below should be access
#	restricted to only execute the server program on a host that
#	also has your WAN connections.  The UUCP system should simply
#	fail on hosts where the WAN connection is simply not present.
#	This may usually resolve itself automatically as the UUCP
#	daemon program eventually executes on the WAN connected host.
#	But this is a waste of time and resources and may also cause
#	delays in UUCP traffic in certain circumstances.  It might be a
#	good idea to access-restrict the 'pcsuuxqt' service below also
#	but that is not strictly necessary unless you expect a lot of
#	UUCP execution requests to also directly require WAN
#	connectivity.  Administrators should really do whatever they
#	think best for both the types of UUCP execution requests and
#	your WAN configurations.
