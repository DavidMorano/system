PCSPOLL

This program is normally executed by various users.  That is the whole
idea of this program.  This philosophy is designed for environments
where the PCS administrator does not want to have standing servers or a
standing CRON daemon running PCS programs.

Since this program is executed by various users, we have a few options
about how to manage security for the program.  These are summarized as:

+ do not make this program SETUID
+ set the program SETUID and then set the various PCS files or directories
  SETUID also (to enable priviledged operation)

If the program is not SETUID, then you are done and there is no
possible security problem.  If the program is SETUID, then the program
will *attempt* to change its real UID to the PCS username if all of the
PCS area is found to be secure.  Even if the PCS area is not found to
be completely secure, this program will attempt to still stay SETUID
for spawning the service daemons if enough of the PCS area is secure to
support that.
