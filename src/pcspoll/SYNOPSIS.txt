PCSPOLL

Synopsis:

$ pcspoll [service(s) [...]] [-interval] [-d[=runtime]]
	[-m mincheck] [-C configfile]


If no service names are given on program invocation, then all services
in the service-table file that have intervals associated with them will
be processed.

There are three modes of the program:

If service names are given at program invocation and the program is not
running in daemon mode, then those services are started once.  The
program waits for them to complete and then exits.

A daemon mode is defined where the program stays running indefinitely
looping and spawning jobs as the individual service intervals come
due.  A time limit on the length of time that daemon mode is active
can be specified as the 'runtime'.

Finally, and most usually in environments that do not run the program
in daemon mode at a central machine, if the program is started
with no service names and is not running in daemon mode, it will
execute all of the services in the current server table file
once (if necessary), wait for them to exit, and then exit itself.
