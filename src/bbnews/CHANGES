BB


version		description
-------------------------------------------------------

2	= original for Starbase

2a	= fixed argument initialization
	= fixed not closing a directory when exiting 'dirlist'

2b	= changed to the new logging file call symantics

2c	= changed default creation permissions on user's mail
	  directory (usually '~/mail') to 775
	= changed default create permissions on user's mailbox to
	  '664'
	= added the 'delete' command
	= removed the header files 'bbopts.h' and 'argopts.h' and
	  included their contents directly where used
	= cleaned up the 'readdir_r' buffer size in 'dirlist.c'

2d	= as of 96/08/29 this is still being worked on
	= dynamically try to find the MAILHOST that we use
	= added support for METAMAIL!!
	= fixed a bug with the "Skip" command quitting instead

2e
	= added "subscribe", "unsubscribe" interactive commands
	= added "subscribe", "unsubscribe" command line options
	= added "catchup" command line option
	= added "query" command line option
	= created the mechanism for NEVER showing/processing an article
	  more than once to the user
	= fixed (??) the determination of the BBNEWSRC file
	= oh, by default, if the user selected no newsgroups,
	  ALL newsgroups are selected!  this is good for new users
	= uses the 'pcsconf' facility to find MAILHOST/FROMNODE
	= added the "description" command line option to print descriptions
	= will recognize "subj" as a subject (formerly only "title" and
	  "subject" were good enough!) ; these can be caused by cross
	  posting from older MSGS systems
	= fixed a possible problem in calling NBBPOST when it was not
	  there (in the user's PATH)
	= the program now has a "-ROOT=programroot" argument for
	  changing the programroot (to something other than ${PCS})
	  at command invocation

2f
	= the program is now POSIX compliant as of 98/06/16,
	  specifically w.r.t. 'readdir_r'

	= a small problem was fixed in reading out the helpfile
	  which is stored in the PCS "lib/bb" directory

	= the program now takes an option key "-BBPOST" to 
	  specify a BBPOST program to use instead of the default

2g
	= the program now takes an option key "-PAGER" to 
	  specify a PAGER program to use instead of the default

	= the program accepts a "PAGER" environment variable to 
	  specify a PAGER program to use instead of the default

	= added the "popscreen" (through BBOPTS only for now) option to 
	  allow for smooth article content display on ANSI terminals.
	  The feature is now the default on ANSI terminals.

	  Example:

	  $ BBOPTS="-popscreen" bb

	  will shut OFF the feature.

	= the number of lines of article content displayed is
	  now adjustable (down only from the number of terminal lines)
	  through a specification on the program invocation arguments.

	  Example:

	  $ bb -15

	  will cause a display of 15 article content lines per
	  screenfull of output.


= version 2h

+ 
The way in which previous directories that are an alias of the current
one are not shown has been changed.  Most of the change was to just
cleanup the 'dirshown' object!  The 'shownp' global variable has been
removed!! :-)

+
The next step is to rewrite 'outbulls' to not use the global 'bulls'
array but rather a 'veclist' object.  All articles from all directories
making up a newsgroup should be put into the list and then the list
sorted!  This should allow for backing up to previous articles that
have earlier dates also.


= version 2i

+ 
I did it!  (the big re-write).
The 'outbulls' subroutine is gone!
The 'initbulls' subroutine is gone!
the 'read_dir' subroutine and its sorting subroutine(s) are gone!
All of these are replaced with the new 'procng' subroutine.
The formerly global 'count' variable is also gone!  Whew, we
want to get rid of those substantive global variables.


= version 2j, 00/01/02, Dave Morano

+ 
Y2K fix for UNIX returning year >= 100 after Jan 1, 2000.

+
All of the processing (reading or writing) of the user newgroup list
file is now done in its own module named 'bbnewsrc'.

+
I have also removed many global variables from the way back old days.
Those old global variables were in there from the very beginning back
over 20 years ago!!

-
There may be a possible bug in the 'emit_item' subroutine.
A core dump (!) occurs.  Maybe it occurs on certain message headers
or combinations there of.


= version 2k, 00/04/19, Dave Morano

Well can you believe it ?  I actually found another true bug in this
software!  It had to do with the number of terminal lines to use for
the given terminal the user is on.  In subroutine 'gettermlines' it was
subtracting four (4) from the number of terminal lines that the user's
terminal is supposed to have!  Yes, yes, this was a hold-over from who
knows how long ago when the program was crap and they calculated
everything in the one subroutine.  But for that sort of a (one would
think more obvious) bug to last all of these years is something
amazing.  Well it was a relatively simple fix but who knows what
I may have broken by with this "fix"!

OK, initial feedback is in.  Something IS still broken but it does
not significantly mess up anything.  The first page of lines
from a long article does not go all the way down to the end of the
user's terminal screen area (as I suppose it should do) but instead
falls one line short of the goal.  Remarkably, this does not
mess up any following pages or alignments.
