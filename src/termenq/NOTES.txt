TERM-ENQ

When a terminal line goes active (carrier-detect turns on), an enquiry is
supposed to be made to the terminal from the first (or early) login-like program
that executes. This program is often the program invoked from the terminal
monitor (TTYMON as controlled by SAC). The result of the terminal enquiry is
supposed to be a terminal code. The terminal code is looked up in a database
consisting of the tupples:

	code,location,multiplexor,port

where:

line		"line" of the terminal
dev		device file-path
multiplexor	is the name of the multiplexor through which this
		terminal's connection was made
port		is the name of the port on the multiplexor that the
		physical terminal is connected to
code		is the code returned from the terminal enquiry
termtype	if found from "code"
location	is an ASCII human readable representation of the terminal
		location

The "line" of the terminal is determined in the usual way (by searching
'/dev/' for matching criteria as given by the terminal file descriptor
(presummably in hand).

Once the location of the terminal is found from the above database, it should be
made available to subsequent programs by placing it in the execution
environment. The multiplexor and port can optionally also be placed into the
environment. The location value should be concise enough so that it can be
conveneiently used as a key in other operations.

After login is essentially completed by the login-system, an entry should be
made in the PCS user-location database consisting of:

username
node
line
id
host
time
pid (sid)
location
