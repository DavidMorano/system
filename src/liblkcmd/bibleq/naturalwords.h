/**** extra credit:

The longest (real) word in the English language -- all we really care
about -- is 'pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis'.  It is 45
characters long.  For those interested it is a (lung) disease and is the
same as silicosis.  However, names of chemicals can be almost any length
(not even counting DNA as some people are increasingly coming across).
So we set a limit at 60 for now.  If we run into trouble, we will extend
this as necessary.
