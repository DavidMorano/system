        This little subroutine was put together so that for those situations
        where only the number of CPUs is desired (not often the case, but
        sometimes) we do not have to go through the process (hassle) of using
        the KINFO object directly (oh like that is a huge problem).

	= 2010-12-09, David A­D­ Morano
        I enhanced this subroutine to get the number of CPUs without using the
        KINFO object. That KINFO object (as it is and has been) is NOT
        reentrant. This is no fault of my own (since I wrote that KINFO code
        also) but rather from Sun-Solaris. The KINFO object uses the underlying
        Solaris KSTAT facility -- which is not reentrant (and therefore not
        thread-safe). I needed a thread-safe way of getting the number of CPUs
        so I had to add some sort of mechanism to do that. We have (basically)
        cheap and cheaper ways to do it. I tried regular 'cheap' and got tired,
        so I switched to 'cheaper'. The 'cheaper' version is the shared-memory
        thing I added below. The regular 'cheap' one was to query the MSINFO or
        MSU facility. The latter is left unfinished due to time constraints.
        Also, it (naturally) took longer than desired to even to the 'cheaper'
        solution.

/*******************************************************************************

        This subroutine returns the number of CPUs available from the current
        node. We do note that the number of CPUs can change dynamically as some
        may be added or removed during the course of live machine operation. We
        allow the number of CPUs returned to the caller to be zero (0) even
        though it is not clear how this might happen. This sort of assumes that
        the caller understands (believes) that at least one CPU is available at
        any time -- otherwise how would we be able to execute in the first
        place!

	Notes:

	= Load-averages

        Although load-averages are available when retrieving SYSMISC
        (miscellaneous system) information from the kernel, we don't bother with
        it at all since the general introduction of the 'getloadavg(3c)'
        subroutine in the workd. If that subroutine was not available,
        load-averages would have to be treated as being as difficult to retrieve
        as the number of CPUs is.

	= NOT thread-safe!

	This subroutine is not thread-safe!  This is because the KINFO object
	is not thread-safe.
