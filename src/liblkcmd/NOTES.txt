LIBLKCMD

This is (primarily) a library of builtin commands for the KSH shell
program.  These same KSH builtin commands can be made into actual programs
in their own right by making the target 'liblkcmd.x' and installing that
and hardlinks to it as the names of the programs corresponding to the
builtin commands.

Both the library (shared library) and the stand-alone program versions
of the commands can be installed with:

$ make strip install ; installprog

Design notes:

Every effort (more than wanted) has been made to make these commands
appear to be and act like real programs.  Real program run in their own
address spaces.  This gives them a number of capabilities (often related
to poor programming practices) that these commands do not enjoy.  Every
effort has been made to make these commands work in a recursive fashion;
that is, that these commands may accidentally call other one of these same
commands either directly or indirectly through some other intermediary.
Efforts have been made to allow this to happen in a way that allows
these commands to act as much like real programs as possible.  But this
is not perfect.  One are where this illusion starts to break down is the
handling of signals.  Another area where this illusion starts to break
down (ok, it breaks down somewhat) is in the passing of environment down
to called programs.  Due to both the inherent limitations of recursive
environment handling and an additional limitation (accidentally) created
by the way that SHELL builtins (for the KSH) are called from the SHELL, 
other environment related limits might appear.

Now, you say, how do these commands get nested since none of them appear
to ever call any of the others?  :-)  That is left as an exercise for
the reader!  Hint: exceedingly subtly.

But if I must say so myself (and I will), I went to quite a length
to make these commands function similarly when called in a recursive
(nested) manner.
