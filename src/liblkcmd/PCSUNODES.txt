PCSUNODES

The PCS User-Nodes (PCSUNODES) database contains the names of machine nodes (and
NET domain names) that share the same user space (like a cluster for example).
This database is used to determine the domain names for machines where a
mail-address of the form 'user@doammin' or 'node!user' is the final destination.
