SAFIX

This small program fixes the stupid errors that SPAMASSASSIN makes when a mail
message is NOT a spam message.  The error is that it forgets to write an EOL
(linefeed character) at the end of its stupid 'x-spam-level' header when the
mail message is not spam.

That is a totally stupid mistake that wreaks havoc!  This is the reason that
Open-Source software SUCKS so badly!  It's always crap!
