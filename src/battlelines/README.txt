BattleLines

This is a Java application which is normally embedded into a web page. This
application starts out by presenting many colored lines on the canvas. But as a
line touches another line, one of the lines is erased (killed off). Eventually
most all of the lines are erased. Once the number of lines falls below some
threshold, a timer is set and when the timer expires, the whole process starts
over with a new set of lines.
