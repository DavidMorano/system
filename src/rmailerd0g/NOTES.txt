RMAILERD

This is the daemon program for the server side of the RMAILER protocol.

This program can either be run from another server with the input
coming in on this program's standard input, or it can run as a standing
server itself.

Run from server-listener:

$ rmailerd


To run it as a stand-alone server, first setup everything in the
configuration file as you want it, then:

$ rmailerd -d


Commentary:

This old email trunking mechanism is old but it is still serving
faithfully.


This is the daemon program for the server side of the RMAILER protocol.


protocol
===============================================================================

	Incoming messages are collected from the input in four (4) phases.
	The phases are ordered and formatted as :

	Phase 0
	- version

	Phase 1 (provides multiplexing of multiple hosts to share a trunk)
	- originating host

	Phase 2 (provides multiplexing of jobs to share a host)
	- job ID
	- envelope "from"
	- message options
	- length of message and optional checksum
	- recipients (as many as there are, one per line)
	- blank line marking the end-of-header

	Phase 3
	- message part (the length of which was given by value above)


	Phases 1 through 3 can be repeated (as a unit) as necessary until
	the input is empty.
