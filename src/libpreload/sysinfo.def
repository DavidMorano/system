# SYSINFO

#
# This file provides an over-ride for (some) values returned using
# the library (lib-c) call |sysinfo(2)|.  Currently, this file is
# only in effect if the Solaris® system default library function is
# interposed upon by our interposer.
#
# Values for these variables are found in this order:
#	1. process environment (e­g­ 'HOSTID')
# 	2. this file
#	3. system default
#
# Once a value is found, it is cached internally (per-process)
# for up to two (2) hours.
#
#

#
# Currently supported values that can be over-ridden are:
#	HOSTID (Solaris® defined name 'SI_HW_SERIAL')
#
#

# currently disabled
#HOSTID=0x00000001
