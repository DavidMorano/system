PCSMAIL revision history:

version 1c

This version is enhanced over the 1B version.  This version will
try to figure out where the headers of a message end in addition
to looking for a blank line.  Use this at your own risk.

version 1d

There was a problem with the 'libb' (bcopyblock) subroutine.
This package was recompiled to include the fix, which WAS causing
problems.

version 1e

1) Renamed the function 'getdate' since it conflicted with a previous
   UNIX System V routine of some sort.

2) Redefined some variable in 'pipeit' ('savepsig') so get a clean compile.

3) Renamed the variables that hold the date strings for the UNIX
   envelope header as well as the RFC 822 "DATE" header.

4) Compiled for the first time on UNIX System V OS.  It is clean.

5) I had to convert to using the new LOG interface !

6) I changed the error log facility over to the new LOG interface also !

7) I changed the way that a supplied file is used.  Before, a supplied
   file with a return path turned off the switch specifying that a file
   was supplied in the first place.  This seemed to be some sort of
   bug fix to do this originally.  I had to undo the original change
   to allow VMAIL to do replies with the included message.  We will
   see what happens !!

8) Oh, I almost forgot, after performing fix '1' above, I also
   fixed the forms of the date strings used in the outgoing mail
   messages.  They now look like what the latest System V UNIX is
   doing (pretty much).

8) Recompiled under Solaris 2.3.

9) I fixed a bad error in "put_in_mbag" leading to core dump.

10) I fixed the way the program's invocation name is determined
    for some error reporting purposes.

11) I fixed another "core dumping" loose pointer bug in 'cookname.c'
    again !  This is the second bug found in this module during this
    last revision cycle.

12) I added the user list logging for user's of the NUSERFILE
    which is meant to log users of the "N"ew version of this program.
    I need the names of people who run the new version to see if
    there are any complaints.

13) Copies of outgoing mail messages which are meant to be stored
    in the user's own "copy" mailbox are now posted there through
    the execution of the PCSCL program.  This adds appropriate
    content length information to the message so that the messages
    stored in the user's "copy" mailbox are parsed correctly.

14) I added some code to check if the PCSCL is in the user's PATH.

1) I fixed the reply message messed up differently.
