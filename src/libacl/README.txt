LIBACL

These are subroutines that need to be generalized for Access-Control-List
(ACL) operations.  These are very old functions (now), about 40
years now.  These were used in the past, but are not generalized
to different operating systems.  The initial taget (Solaris®) was
very adapated to the original POSIX® draft standard.  But that draft
standard left some elements of the facility unspecified and left
up to individual operating systems to implement.  In the mean time
POSIX® has since dropped (discontinued) the draft standard, so this
whole facility is sort of in abeyance.
