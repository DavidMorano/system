BBFILE

I really have little idea what this little program was used for (assuming that
it is no longer being used). It appears to have taken a string of some sort as
an argument and converted it into a legal filename.

Yes, I think this was used to create legal filenames out of strings that were
created somehow that might have contained characters that are "not good" to use
as characters in file names. This was likely used within some SHELL program, I
would think.

Got it! I remember now. The guessing above was pretty right on. This was used
within the very-old BBPOST program to create a legal filename that could be put
into the newsgroup spool area. The filename was created out of the leading
characters of the subject of the article being posted! Yes, that is how crude
things were in the bad old days! All posting is now done using RBBPOST (if
underneath the hood) so there is no need for the old BBFILE program any longer.
