STRIPOPGARB

This program strips operand garbage from some sort of trace file that is
generated from some other program. I think that the other program was something
that created some sort of intermediate trace format file from the output of
running DBX on a benchmark program. The output from this program was used as
input to the more significant trace conversion program. Probably the file trace
produced was an ET trace.

This program was a part of the Levo research project.
