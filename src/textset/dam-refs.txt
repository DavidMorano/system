by AT&T).

Nokia and was folded into the Nokia company brand in January of 2016.

+ Philips Consumer Communications

This company was formed through a merger of a part of a subsidiary of
Lucent Technologies and Royal Philips Electronics. The official merger
was completed on Oct 7, 2016. The company subsequently was subsequently
dissolved in 1998. Lucent Technologies solved its share after the
dissolution to Motorola, itself subsequently bought by Google.

For employement information during my time from January 1997 through
October 1997, please contact Nokia above.

From January 1997 through October 1997, although I worked in the Holmdel
NJ location (co-located with both Lucent Technologies and AT&T), the
official headquarters of the company was in Parsippany NJ (USA).
