MAN

This is a hack-special version of the 'man(1)' program. This forces the use of
the Sun-native versions of the 'nroff(1)', 'eqn(1)' and/or 'neqn(1)' programs
for preprocessing. Use of the Sun-native version of those support programs is
needed for some of Sun's manual pages.

As compensation to handle DWB-style manual pages, the extra DWB manual macros
have been added to the Sun standard manual macros.
