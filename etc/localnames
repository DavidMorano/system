# LOCALNAMES

#
# This file contains the various names that the local-host is known by.
# The node-name, cluster-name, and node-domain-name (using the default
# domain) are generally figured out by software components without any
# entries here.  But all strange names for the local-host should be listed
# since there is no way to automatically figure them out (no easy way).
# 

#
# format of entries:
#
# <node>: <name(s)>
#
# where <name(s)> are a comma-separated list of names
#
