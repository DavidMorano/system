* Notes:
* + only the first column (month/day) is significiant for accouting
* + aditional "columns" (the rest of a line) is a description
* + the first word of the description is used as a description-key
* + comment lines start with an asterisk
* + continuation lines are not supported
* 
* Idealy, there should not be either a plus ('+') or a minus ('-') sign
* in the first word of the description (called the description-key above).
* This is because a plus or minus sign is used as a field separator
* in the CALYEARS database facility, which draws on this database for
* resolving description-keys.
