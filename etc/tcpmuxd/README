TCPMUXD

This directory is searched (among other places) for configuration
information for the TCPMUXD servers if they are configured to use this
distribution tree as their program root.

Defaults are applied for about everything but configuration files found
here will be used in the default case and when alternate configuration
information is not provided at program invocation.
